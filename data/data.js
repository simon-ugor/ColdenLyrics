Despite taking these privacy-protective actions, teen social media users do not express a high level of concern about third-parties (such as businesses or advertisers) accessing their data; just 9% say they are “very” concerned.Key findings include:Teens are sharing more information about themselves on their social media profiles than they did when we last surveyed in 2006:- 91% post a photo of themselves, up from 79% in 2006.- 71% post their school name, up from 49%.- 71% post the city or town where they live, up from 61%.- 53% post their email address, up from 29%.- 20% post their cell phone number, up from 2%.60% of teen Facebook users set their Facebook profiles to private (friends only), and most report high levels of confidence in their ability to manage their settings.- 56% of teen Facebook users say it’s “not difficult at all” to manage the privacy controls on their Facebook profile.- 33% Facebook-using teens say it’s “not too difficult.”- 8% of teen Facebook users say that managing their privacy controls is “somewhat difficult,” while less than 1% describe the process as “very difficult.”ABOUT THE SURVEYThese findings are based on a nationally representative phone survey run by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project of 802 parents and their 802 teens ages 12-17. It was conducted between July 26 and September 30, 2012. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish and on landline and cell phones. The margin of error for the full sample is ± 4.5 percentage points.This report marries that data with insights and quotes from in-person focus groups conducted by the Youth and Media team at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University beginning in February 2013. The focus groups focused on privacy and digital media, with special emphasis on social media sites. The team conducted 24 focus group interviews with 156 students across the greater Boston area, Los Angeles (California), Santa Barbara (California), and Greensboro (North Carolina). Each focus group lasted 90 minutes, including a 15-minute questionnaire completed prior to starting the interview, consisting of 20 multiple-choice questions and 1 open-ended response. Although the research sample was not designed to constitute representative cross-sections of particular population(s), the sample includes participants from diverse ethnic, racial, and economic backgrounds. Participants ranged in age from 11 to 19. The mean age of participants is 14.5.In addition, two online focus groups of teenagers ages 12-17 were conducted by the Pew Internet Project from June 20-27, 2012 to help inform the survey design. The first focus group was with 11 middle schoolers ages 12-14, and the second group was with nine high schoolers ages 14-17. Each group was mixed gender, with some racial, socio-economic, and regional diversity. The groups were conducted as an asynchronous threaded discussion over three days using an online platform and the participants were asked to log in twice per day.Throughout this report, this focus group material is highlighted in several ways. Pew’s online focus group quotes are interspersed with relevant statistics from the survey in order to illustrate findings that were echoed in the focus groups or to provide additional context to the data. In addition, at several points, there are extensive excerpts boxed off as standalone text boxes that elaborate on a number of important themes that emerged from the in-person focus groups conducted by the Berkman Center.",

It's the Pay Equity Act, passed in 1964,when womenwere making fifty-nine cents to the dollar.SAMWhat are you making now?AINSLEYSeventy-nine cents.SAMSo, everything's fine.AINSLEYNo, there are still some problems. But I'm not worried 'cause the federalgovernment'scoming to the rescue.SAMLook...AINSLEYYou think pay disparity is 'cause some sexist in human resources hired twopeople forequal positions and paid the man more?SAMOftentimes...AINSLEYAnd oftentimes women make less money over the course of their lifetimesbecause theychoose to.SAMOh, goodnight nurse! They don't choose to make less money. They're financiallypunishedfor having kids.AINSLEYThey make a choice to have kids.SAMWell, not necessarily if you guys have your way, but that's a different canof tuna.[beat] I flat-out guarantee you that if men were biologically responsible forprocreation, there'd be paid family leave in every Fortune 500.AINSLEYSam, if men were biologically responsible for procreation, they'd fall downand die atthe first sonogram.Sam and Ainsley walk into THE MESS. Sam checks out the coffee maker whileAinsley gathersup cups and saucers.SAMIf the Amendment's redundant, what's your problem if it's passed or not?AINSLEYBecause I'm a Republican! Have we met? I believe that every time the federalgovernmenthands down a new law, it leaves for the rest of us a little less freedom. SoI say,let's just stick to the ones we absolutely need to have water come out ofthe faucetand our cars not stolen.

Sam is carrying the tray of coffee.ED[to Sam] What the hell took so long?SAMWe got the coffee but I spilled it coming up the stairs, you know, the firstcouple oftimes. Where's Josh?DONNAYou sent him to get the thing.SAMFor how long? I've had time to spill coffee, you know, a lot.DONNAI'll find him.Donna stands up and leaves to find Josh.SAMSo, guys...EDYeah?SAMWhen I was downstairs, I made a decision. I'm gonna register with theRepublican Party,and I'll tell you why, if you're curious. It's because they're a freedom-lovingpeople.AINSLEYWe also like beef.SAMYou know, you insist government is depraved for not legislating against whatwe can seeon the newsstands, or what we can see in an art exhibit, or what we can burnin protest,or which sex we're allowed to have sex with, or a woman's right to choose,but don't youdare try to regulate this deadly weapon I have concealed on me, for thatwould encroachagainst my freedom.AINSLEYYeah? And Democrats believe in free speech as long as it isn't prayer whileyou'restanding in school. You believe in the Freedom of Information Act except ifyou want tofind out if your fourteen-year-old daughter's had an abortion...SAMWe believe in the ERA.AINSLEYWell, go get 'em.SAMHow can you have an objection to something that says...?AINSLEYBecause it's humiliating! A new amendment that we vote on, declaring that I am equal under the law to a man. I am mortified to discover there's reason to believe I wasn't before. I am a citizen of this country. I am not a special subset in need of your protection. I do not have to have to have my rights handed down to me by a bunch of old, white men. The same Article 14 that protects you, protects me. And I went to law school just to make sure. And with that, I'm going back down to the mess, because I thought I may have seen, there, a peach.

Thanksfortaking me back. [walks out of his office] Oh, and the flowers are beautiful.Josh stands in the doorway staring after her.CUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHTLeo and Toby sit silently facing each other.TOBYWhy not heightened security?LEOHmm?TOBYAt the airports. Why not heightened security? What's the downside?Leo and Toby stand as Bartlet enters from the veranda.BARTLET[leaning on a wing chair] Sorry about that.LEOWhat's going on?BARTLETCharlie! [to Leo] I've got to make the call.CHARLIE[enters] Yes, sir?BARTLETLet's get Gareth back.Charlie nods and closes the door. Bartlet sighs and glances at Toby. Tobymeets his gaze,then looks away. Bartlet checks his watch. Leo senses the tension, looks atToby, thenlooks at Bartlet.LEOToby was just asking what the downside of going to a security condition was.BARTLETThe scanners they use take an hour to search the luggage of 250 passengers. Theconditionrequires two photo IDs. Most people only have one. Delays. Delays are thedownside.CHARLIE[knocks] Mr. Gareth.BARTLETThat timed out well.Bartlet sits down in the chair and picks up the phone. Leo and Toby sit onthe sofas.BARTLET[into phone] Hal? Okay, let's do it. I'm ordering the airports to a2-condition. You'llhave it in writing in about five minutes. Thanks. [hangs up, to Leo] I didn'tknow enough.TOBYI know the feeling.BARTLET[calmly] I have no intention of apologizing to you, Toby.TOBYWould you mind if I ask why not?BARTLET'Cause you're not the one with MS, a wife, three kids and airports toclose. Not everypart of me belongs to you. This was personal. I'm not willing to relinquishthat right.Bartlet stands up, walks over behind his desk. Leo and Toby stand.TOBYIt will appear to many, if not most, as fraud. It will appear as if youdenied the votersan opportunity to decide for themselves. They're generally not willing torelinquish thatright, either.Bartlet and Leo silently and solemnly look at each other, absorbing Toby'swords.The clock ticks softly in the background.BARTLETYeah.TOBYMr. President, at some point in the near future, we're going to have tospeak to somelawyers.BARTLETWell, that's what usually brings on the episodes, but if you say so.TOBY[laughs quietly and icily to himself] It's 17 people, by the way.BARTLETI'm sorry?TOBYYou knew. We weren't counting you. It's 17 people.Bartlet looks at Leo, who looks pained. Bartlet removes his glasses, putsthem down onhis desk and sighs wearily.BARTLETI don't know. [shakes his head slowly] It may have been unbelievably stupid. Itmay havebeen unthinkably stupid. I don't know.Toby meets Bartlet's gaze.BARTLETI'm sorry. I really am.Leo is stunned. Toby shifts a bit from side to side. They are all silentfor severalmoments.TOBYI've gotta go in the other room and uh...BARTLETYeah. I'll see you tomorrow. Thanks.TOBYThank you, Mr. President.Toby leaves the Oval Office but does not close the door behind him. He pauses briefly in the foyer, then proceeds a few steps across the hall to THE ROOSEVELT ROOM and opens the door. Voices and laughter envelope Toby as he enters the room and sits down at the table.JOSH [OS]That was... I think that's a good one.There is general good-humored disagreement with Josh.SAM [OS]Toby!DONNA [OS]Toby!JOSH [OS]We're dying here, what do you got?ED [OS]Um, okay.

The NASDAQ just filed fornot-for-profitstatus.SAM [OS]Toby.Sam tosses Toby his ball, which he catches. Toby looks pained, but continuesto listento joke suggestions.AINSLEY [OS]Okay, what about the one about the Pentagon?Over Toby's shoulder, framed by the French doors of the Roosevelt Room,Bartlet signs adocument as Charlie looks on. Leo steps into view, with a stern look on hisface, andcloses the door to the Oval Office.JOSH [OS]Okay, uh, you have to try and imagine that the President is saying it. Tellme if youthink this is funny.A single sound echoes the opening rhythm of Toby bouncing his ball againstthe wall.DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.FADE TO BLACK.THE END",

Toby, about 10 years ago, for a period of a few months, I was feeling run down and had a pain in my leg. They both subsided, but 8 years ago, the pain came back, as well as numbness. My vision would become blurry and I'd feel dizzy. During an eye exam, the doctor detected abnormal pupil responses and ordered an MRI. The radiologist found plaque on my brain and spine.

MS is a chronic disease of the central nervous system.

The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was</p><p>with me as</p><p>were the Secretaries of State and Defense.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Do you receive medication?</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>I'm sorry?</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Do you receive medication?</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>I get injections of Betaseron.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>From whom?</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>From a doctor.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>None of your current doctors are aware of your condition... Mr. President,</p><p>is your wife</p><p>medicating you?</p><p></p><p>Leo enters.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>I think it would be best while temperature are running a little high if you</p><p>refer to my</p><p>wife as Mrs. Bartlet or the First Lady.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>[quietly] Yes sir.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>What you got, Leo?</p><p></p><p>Leo steps around the couch and hands Bartlet a folder.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>They'd like a few more minutes.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>The FAA?</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Yeah.</p><p></p><p>Bartlet rises and they walk to his desk.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>Talk me through what heightened security means.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Well, they deploy more uniformed police and the dogs. They hand search</p><p>luggage.</p><p></p><p>Toby sits on the couch deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>They discontinue...</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Curbside checking. Eliminate the first two rows of short term parking.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>Okay, they want a few minutes?</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Yeah</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>[sarcastic] Toby's concerned that the peaceful solution I brokered last year</p><p>in Kashmir</p><p>was the result of a drug induce haze.</p><p></p><p>Toby looks at the President.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>[to Toby] I was there with him. So was Fitz. So was Cashman, Hutchinson,</p><p>Berryhill...</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Well, that's fantastic.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Toby!</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>None of you were elected!</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>I was elected, they were appointed. [points at Leo] The Vice President was</p><p>elected.</p><p>He has the constitutional authority to assume my...</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Not last May he didn't. [rises] He didn't last May when you were under</p><p>general anesthesia.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>That's because I never signed the letter and I don't think I got shot because</p><p>I got MS.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>I don't think you did either, sir. I meant that during a night of extreme</p><p>chaos and fear,</p><p>when we didn't yet know if we'd been the victims of domestic or-or foreign</p><p>terrorism or</p><p>even an act of war there was uncertainty as to who was giving the National</p><p>Security</p><p>orders and that was because you never signed a letter!</p><p></p><p>Leo looks uncomfortable. The President glares at Toby.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>I don't like to wonder, given your condition and it's lack of predictability</p><p>why there</p><p>isn't simply a signed letter sitting in a file someplace? And the answer</p><p>is... [laughs]</p><p>of course, if there was a-a signed letter sitting in a file someplace,</p><p>somebody would</p><p>ask why.</p><p></p><p>Bartlet looks angrily at Leo.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>[angry] The Commander-In-Chief had just been attacked. He was under a general</p><p>anesthetic.</p><p>A fugitive was at large, the manhunt included every federal, state and local</p><p>law</p><p>enforcement agency. The Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and</p><p>Delaware</p><p>National Guard was federalized! The KH-10 showed Republican Guard movement</p><p>in southern</p><p>Iraq. [yelling] And twelve hours earlier an F-117 was shot down in the no fly,</p><p>and the</p><p>Vice President's authority was murky at best!</p><p></p><p>Barely controlling his anger, Bartlet walks behind his desk.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>The National Security Advisor and Secretary of State didn't know who they were taking their orders from! I wasn't in the Situation Room that night but I'll bet all the money in my pockets against all the money in your pockets that it was Leo... who no one elected! For 90 minutes that night there was a coup d'etat in this country.</p><p></p><p>Bartlet stands furious. Leo looks at Toby.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>And the walls came tumbling down. I feel fine by the way. Thanks for asking.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Sir...</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>[angry] No, Toby's concern for my health is moving me in ways...</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Mr. President....</p><p></p><p>Bartlet furiously throws the folder across his desk.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>[yelling] SHUT UP!</p><p></p><p>Bartlet stalks back around the desk and faces Toby.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>[condescending] You know your indignation would be a lot more interesting</p><p>to me if it</p><p>wasn't quite so covered in crap!</p><p></p><p>Charlie stands in the doorway.</p><p></p><p>CHARLIE</p><p>Sir...</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>[while glaring at Toby] Yeah.</p><p></p><p>CHARLIE</p><p>Mr. Garreth.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>[acknowledges Charlie] Thanks.</p><p></p><p>Charlie quietly closes the door behind him.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>[angry] Are you pissed because I didn't say anything or are you pissed</p><p>because there</p><p>were 15 people who knew before you did? I feel fine by the way. Thanks for</p><p>asking.</p><p></p><p>Bartlet walks to the other side of the room. Leo, standing between them,</p><p>stares in shock.</p><p>He puts his hand to his forehead. Toby stands quietly looking at nothing.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>[to Bartlet] Take the call in here.</p><p></p><p>Bartlet nods.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>[to Toby] We'll step outside for a minute.</p><p></p><p>Leo motions to the door. Bartlet glares at Toby. Toby looks at him quickly</p><p>before</p><p>following Leo out. Bartlet walks back over to the couches and collects</p><p>himself for</p><p>a moment. He then picks up the phone.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>[into phone] Yeah, this is the President.</p><p></p><p>FADE OUT.</p><p>END ACT THREE</p><p>* * *</p><p></p><p>ACT FOUR</p><p></p><p>FADE IN: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT</p><p>Sam, Donna, Josh, Ainsley, Larry and Ed are sitting at the large table and</p><p>are huddled</p><p>around an easel, brainstorming ideas for the speech.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Self-deprecation.</p><p></p><p>ED</p><p>Yes.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Self-deprecation is what we need.</p><p></p><p>LARRY</p><p>Yes.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Self-deprecation is the appetizer of charm.</p><p></p><p>ED</p><p>We need jokes about the staff.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>We need jokes about the staff.</p><p></p><p>AINSLEY</p><p>[to Sam] Let's start with you.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Problem is there aren't many jokes you can make about me.</p><p></p><p>DONNA</p><p>How about this. Um, Knock knock. Who's there? Sam and his prostitute</p><p>friend.</p><p></p><p>Ainsley, Ed and Larry laugh.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>See, I think that was a bit of misdirected anger there.</p><p></p><p>DONNA</p><p>I'm okay with that.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Well, in that case, Ainsley, you know why I got you flowers in April instead</p><p>of February?</p><p>'Cause you ditched me the first time around to go back to the guy who ditched</p><p>you the</p><p>first time around only to have him ditch you the second time around.</p><p></p><p>Donna smacks Josh upside the back of the head.</p><p></p><p>JOSH</p><p>Ow! What the hell? That was him!</p><p></p><p>DONNA</p><p>He was being you!</p><p></p><p>JOSH</p><p>Well, in fairness, I think everybody should have a turn. Sam, is there</p><p>anything we can</p><p>pull, anything funny we can recycle?</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Yeah, pull something I wrote from October called Government-wide</p><p>Accountability for</p><p>Merit System Principles.</p><p></p><p>JOSH</p><p>That one was a real barn-burner, was it?</p><p></p><p>Josh stands up from the table, groaning, and exits the room to find the old</p><p>speech.</p><p></p><p>DONNA</p><p>[to Sam] Do you have any idea how much grief I took from him when I came back?</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>How much?</p><p></p><p>DONNA</p><p>None. I walked in the door. He said, Thank God. There's a pile of stuff on the desk. This is his way. He's just going to snark me every April. Prince of passive-aggressive behavior.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>What does snark mean?</p><p></p><p>DONNA</p><p>I don't know, but he's doing it.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>There any coffee left?</p><p></p><p>ED</p><p>In the mess.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Anybody want anything?</p><p></p><p>AINSLEY</p><p>Do you think they have cheesecake down there?</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>[looks at his watch] It's quarter after midnight. The pastry chef usually</p><p>stays on</p><p>till dawn.</p><p></p><p>AINSLEY</p><p>I'll go see if there is.</p><p></p><p>Sam and Ainsley leave together out to the HALLWAY.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>You know, we should make a joke about women, since there's no law against</p><p>that or paying</p><p>them less money than men.</p><p></p><p>AINSLEY</p><p>Well, there is a law against that. It's the Pay Equity Act, passed in 1964,</p><p>when women</p><p>were making fifty-nine cents to the dollar.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>What are you making now?</p><p></p><p>AINSLEY</p><p>Seventy-nine cents.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>So, everything's fine.</p><p></p><p>AINSLEY</p><p>No, there are still some problems. But I'm not worried 'cause the federal</p><p>government's</p><p>coming to the rescue.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Look...</p><p></p><p>AINSLEY</p><p>You think pay disparity is 'cause some sexist in human resources hired two</p><p>people for</p><p>equal positions and paid the man more?</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Oftentimes...</p><p></p><p>AINSLEY</p><p>And oftentimes women make less money over the course of their lifetimes</p><p>because they</p><p>choose to.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Oh, goodnight nurse! They don't choose to make less money. They're financially</p><p>punished</p><p>for having kids.</p><p></p><p>AINSLEY</p><p>They make a choice to have kids.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Well, not necessarily if you guys have your way, but that's a different can</p><p>of tuna.</p><p>[beat] I flat-out guarantee you that if men were biologically responsible for</p><p>procreation, there'd be paid family leave in every Fortune 500.</p><p></p><p>AINSLEY</p><p>Sam, if men were biologically responsible for procreation, they'd fall down</p><p>and die at</p><p>the first sonogram.</p><p></p><p>Sam and Ainsley walk into THE MESS. Sam checks out the coffee maker while</p><p>Ainsley gathers</p><p>up cups and saucers.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>If the Amendment's redundant, what's your problem if it's passed or not?</p><p></p><p>AINSLEY</p><p>Because I'm a Republican! Have we met? I believe that every time the federal</p><p>government</p><p>hands down a new law, it leaves for the rest of us a little less freedom. So</p><p>I say,</p><p>let's just stick to the ones we absolutely need to have water come out of</p><p>the faucet</p><p>and our cars not stolen. That is my problem with passing a redundant law.</p><p>[stands next to Sam with a full tray] Sam?</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Yeah?</p><p></p><p>AINSLEY</p><p>The all-night pastry chef? You were just kidding about that, right?</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Yeah.</p><p></p><p>Ainsley shoves the tray at Sam and walks toward the exit.</p><p></p><p>CUT TO: EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE PORTICO - NIGHT</p><p>Toby sits on a bench with his head in his hand. Leo walks slowly toward him</p><p>from the</p><p>direction of the Residence. Toby looks up as Leo approaches.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>He's still on the phone with State in the Residence.</p><p></p><p>Leo looks across the White House grounds as thunder rumbles in the distance.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>So Hoynes knows?</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Hoynes is one of the 16?</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Yeah.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>And he thinks the President won't run again?</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>He thinks there's a chance.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Will he?</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>[sits] Will the President run?</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Where's the First Lady?</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>In Manchester.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Why'd she come to me after the State of the Union?</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Toby...</p><p></p><p>Leo looks at Toby, looks away, shakes his head, looks back at him.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Why's she mad at the President? It's because the State of the Union set up</p><p>the</p><p>re-election run and somehow she's under the impression that's not supposed</p><p>to happen.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>The First Lady...</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>I have no kind of investigative mind. Zero. It took me six days and 23</p><p>minutes to</p><p>figure it out.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>He'll run.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Yeah, yeah 'cause we stood in that office a couple of months ago, you and I,</p><p>and you</p><p>said, Take my hand, and we just...</p><p></p><p>Leo bows his head and nods. Toby looks drained and puts his hand to his head</p><p>again.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Never mind.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>He'll run.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Hoynes was fourteen. Who was fifteen?</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Dr. David Lee. The anesthesiologist at GW. He had to know about the</p><p>Betaseron.</p><p>Getting back to Hoynes...</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>I'm sorry, Leo, but I need you to look at me right now and tell me that the</p><p>doctor's</p><p>not under some kind of surveillance.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>The doctor's free to talk to whomever he likes.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Well, I'm sure we're gonna find that out soon enough.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>He's not gonna leak it.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Someone will.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Toby...</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Leo, Hoynes left bread crumbs. He wanted me to find out. A camping trip to</p><p>Killington?</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>That was a jackass move.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>I don't think it was. I think he may be the only one around here who's acting</p><p>responsibly.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>To who?</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>The Democratic Party. Seven and a half months to the Iowa caucus, and no</p><p>one's been told</p><p>the President might not be the nominee!</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>He's gonna run!</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>No, he may not have the option, Leo.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>When this story breaks, it'll be because we broke it, and we'll control it. And the public will accept it. It's not like it's unprecedented that a President conceal health issues. [beat] What do you think is gonna happen? I mean it. What do you think is gonna</p><p>happen?</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>[clears his throat, stands up and faces Leo] Well, I suppose one of five things. The President can decide not to run. He can run and not win. He can run and win.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>And? What are the other two?</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Leo...</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>You think he's gonna need to resign?</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>There's gonna be hearing upon hearing upon hearing.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>He hasn't broken a law.</p><p></p><p>The door to the Oval Office opens. Leo stands up as Charlie steps outside.</p><p></p><p>CHARLIE</p><p>The President's on his way back.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Thanks.</p><p></p><p>Charlie goes back inside and shuts the door.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Says you. [beat] You don't have to break the law to get served with articles of impeachment.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Toby, it is never gonna get that far.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>[chuckles softly] Write down the exact date and time you said that.</p><p></p><p>Toby goes back inside. Leo stares straight ahead watching him go.</p><p></p><p>CUT TO: INT. THE ROOSEVELT ROOM - NIGHT</p><p></p><p>DONNA</p><p>[to Larry and Ed] See, the thing about me, is that mine is a dry wit. And a dry wit, like a fine martini, is best enjoyed...</p><p></p><p>LARRY</p><p>Uh-oh...</p><p></p><p>DONNA</p><p>Yeah, nowhere to go there.</p><p></p><p>Sam and Ainsley walk into the room. Sam is carrying the tray of coffee.</p><p></p><p>ED</p><p>[to Sam] What the hell took so long?</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>We got the coffee but I spilled it coming up the stairs, you know, the first</p><p>couple of</p><p>times. Where's Josh?</p><p></p><p>DONNA</p><p>You sent him to get the thing.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>For how long? I've had time to spill coffee, you know, a lot.</p><p></p><p>DONNA</p><p>I'll find him.</p><p></p><p>Donna stands up and leaves to find Josh.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>So, guys...</p><p></p><p>ED</p><p>Yeah?</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>When I was downstairs, I made a decision. I'm gonna register with the</p><p>Republican Party,</p><p>and I'll tell you why, if you're curious. It's because they're a freedom-loving</p><p>people.</p><p></p><p>AINSLEY</p><p>We also like beef.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>You know, you insist government is depraved for not legislating against what</p><p>we can see</p><p>on the newsstands, or what we can see in an art exhibit, or what we can burn</p><p>in protest,</p><p>or which sex we're allowed to have sex with, or a woman's right to choose,</p><p>but don't you</p><p>dare try to regulate this deadly weapon I have concealed on me, for that</p><p>would encroach</p><p>against my freedom.</p><p></p><p>AINSLEY</p><p>Yeah? And Democrats believe in free speech as long as it isn't prayer while</p><p>you're</p><p>standing in school. You believe in the Freedom of Information Act except if</p><p>you want to</p><p>find out if your fourteen-year-old daughter's had an abortion...</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>We believe in the ERA.</p><p></p><p>AINSLEY</p><p>Well, go get 'em.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>How can you have an objection to something that says...?</p><p></p><p>AINSLEY</p><p>Because it's humiliating! A new amendment that we vote on, declaring that I am equal under the law to a man. I am mortified to discover there's reason to believe I wasn't before. I am a citizen of this country. I am not a special subset in need of your protection. I do not have to have to have my rights handed down to me by a bunch of old, white men. The same Article 14 that protects you, protects me. And I went to law school just to make sure. And with that, I'm going back down to the mess, because I thought I may have seen, there, a peach. [leaves]</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>[to Larry and Ed] I could've countered that, but I'd already moved on to</p><p>other things</p><p>in my head.</p><p></p><p>CUT TO: INT.

[walks around the table]My nameis Sam Seaborn and I'm the Deputy Communications Director. What does that meanexactly? Well, to begin with, I'm a counselor to the President, mostlyon domesticmatters, though generally not security related. I work with Toby Ziegler, theCommunications Director; and C.J. Cregg, the Press Secretary, on crafting ourmessage and getting it out through the electronic and print media. And while myfunctions here are generally perceived to be politically skewed, it'simportant toremember that it is not the D.N.C., but rather your tax dollars that paymy salary.So I work for you whether you voted for us or not.There's an awkward silence in the room before--MALLORYMr. Seaborn, maybe you could give us some history.SAMSure.

Could you tell me whichone ofthose kids is Leo McGarry's daughter?MALLORYWhy?SAMWell, if I could make eye contact with her, make her laugh, you know, justsee thatshe has a good time, it might go a long way toward making my life easier.MALLORYThese children worked hard. All of them. And I'm not inclined at this momentto makeyour life easier.SAMMs. O'Brian, I understand your feelings, but please believe me when I tellyou thatI'm a nice guy having a bad day. I just found out the Times is publishinga pollthat says a considerable portion of Americans feel that the White Househas lostenergy and focus. A perception that's not likely to be altered by thevideo footageof the President riding his bicycle into a tree. As we speak, the CoastGuard arefishing Cubans out of the Atlantic Ocean while the Governor of Florida wants toblockade the Port of Miami. A good friend of mine's about to get fired forgoing ontelevision and making sense, and it turns out I accidentally slept witha prostitutelast night. Now.

I always counted you as a friend.JOSHAnd I'm honored by that, Reverend. First, let me say that when I spoke on theprogram yesterday, I was not speaking for the President or this administration.That's important to know. Second, please allow me to apologize. My remarkswere gliband insulting. I was going for the cheap laugh, and anybody willing to stepup anddebate ideas deserves better than a political punch line. Mary, I apologize.MARY[pause, then turns to Toby] Good then.

Let's move on.VAN DYKEI'd like to discuss why we hear so much talk about the First Amendmentcoming outof this building, but no talk at all about the First Commandment.MARYI don't like what I've just been accused of.TOBY[raising his voice] I'm afraid that's just tough, Mrs. Marsh.VAN DYKEThe First Commandment says Honor thy Father.TOBYNo it doesn't.JOSHToby--TOBYIt doesn't.JOSHListen--TOBYNo, if I'm gonna make you sit through this preposterous exercise, we'regonna getthe names of the damn commandments right.MARYOkay. Here we go.TOBYHonor thy Father is the Third Commandment.VAN DYKEThen what's the First Commandment?A booming voice comes from off screen. The camera moves to show PRESIDENTJED BARTLETwith a cane standing in the doorway with several Secret Service agents.PRESIDENT JED BARTLETI am the Lord your God. Thou shalt worship no other God before me.Boy, those were the days, huh?Everyone stands.CALDWELLGood afternoon, Mr. President.BARTLETAl. What do we got here, C.J.?C.J.Well, we've got some hot tempers, Mr. President.BARTLETMary.JOHN VAN DYKEMr. President, I'm John Van Dyke.BARTLETYes. Reverend?VAN DYKEMay I ask you a question, sir?BARTLETOf course.VAN DYKEIf our children can buy pornography on any street corner for five dollars,isn'tthat too high a price to pay for free speech?BARTLETNo.VAN DYKEReally?BARTLETOn the other hand, I do think that five dollars is too high a price to pay forpornography.C.J.Why don't we all sit down?BARTLETNo. Let's not, C.J. These people won't be staying that long. May I have some coffee, Mr. Lewis? Al, how many times have I asked you to denounce the practices of a fringe group that calls itself The Lambs of God?CALDWELLSir, it's not up to me to...BARTLETCrap. It is up to you, Al. You, know, my wife, Abbey, she never wants me to do anything while I'm upset. [a staffer hands him coffee] Thank you, Mr. Lewis. 28 years ago, I come home from a very bad day at the State House. I tell Abbey I'm going out for a drive. I get in the station wagon, and put it in reverse, and pull out of the garage full speed. [Leo and Sam appear in the doorway and quietly enter into the room.] Except I forgot to open the garage door.Bartlet pauses to take a drink of his coffee and smile at Josh, who smiles backuncomfortably.BARTLET [cont.]Abbey told me to not drive while I was upset and she was right. She was right yesterday when she told me not to get on that damn bicycle while I was upset, but I did it anyway, and I guess I was just about as angry as I've ever been in my life. It seems my granddaughter, Annie, had given an interview in one of the teen magazines. And somewhere between movie stars and make-up tips, she talked about her feelings on a woman's right to choose. Now Annie, all of 12, has always been precocious, but she's got a good head on her shoulders and I like it when she uses it, so I couldn't understand it when her mother called me in tears yesterday. I said, Elizabeth, what's wrong? She said, It's Annie. Now I love my family and I've read my bible from cover to cover so I want you to tell me, from what part of the Holy Scripture do you suppose the Lambs of God drew their Divine inspiration when they sent my 12 year-old granddaughter a Raggedy Ann doll with a knife stuck through its throat? [pause] You'll denounce these people, Al. You'll do it publicly. And until you do, you can all get your fat asses out of my White House.

[They enter the Oval Office.] You, C.J., on the other hand, were brilliant. I particularly liked the part where you said nothing at all.C.J.I'm sorry, Josh, I was distracted. All I could really think about wasLloyd Russell and your girlfriend.SAMMandy and Lloyd Russell?JOSHI'll be puttin' an end to that.BARTLETHello, Mr. President. Did you have a nice trip, sir? How's the ankle, sir? Seems to me we've all been taking a little break. Thinking about our personal lives or thinking about keeping our jobs. Breaks are good. It's not a bad idea taking a break every now and then. I know how hard you all work.MARGARET, Leo's secretary, brings Leo a note, which he slips to Bartlet after reading it.BARTLET[speaks while reading the note] There was this time that Annie came to me with this press clipping. Seems these theologians down in South America were very excited because this little girl from Chile had sliced open a tomato, and the inside flesh of this tomato had actually formed a perfect Rosary. The theologians commented that they thought this was a very impressive girl. Annie commented that she thought it was a very impressive tomato. I don't know what made me think of that. [reporting the information from the slip of paper] Naval Intelligence reports approximately 1200 Cubans left Havana this morning. Approximately 700 turned back due to severe weather, some 350 are missing and presumed dead, 137 have been taken into custody in Miami and are seeking asylum. [pause] With the clothes on their backs, they came through a storm. And the ones that didn't die want a better life. And they want it here. Talk about impressive. My point is this: Break's over.LEOThank you, Mr. President.The senior staff say their thanks and begin to leave the office. Josh isthe lastto the door.BARTLETJosh.

I don't need to tell you that.</p><p></p><p>CALDWELL</p><p>No.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>He's worked with the Southern Baptist Leadership Conference. He's worked with</p><p>the Catholic Relief...</p><p></p><p>CALDWELL</p><p>He's spoken at my church.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Yes, he has.

He never said anything...</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>He doesn't believe that it's the government's place to legislate this</p><p>issue. But</p><p>that has not stopped him from playing his role as a moral leader. Something</p><p>which</p><p>cost him dearly in the campaign and you know that.</p><p></p><p>CALDWELL</p><p>Why does he insist on demonizing us as a group?</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Because your group has plenty of demons.</p><p></p><p>CALDWELL</p><p>[snorts] Every group has plenty of demons.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>You don't have to tell me about it, Reverend.

But when you stand that close to Mary Marsh and John Van</p><p>Dyke, it's</p><p>sometimes hard not to paint you all with the same brush.</p><p></p><p>CALDWELL</p><p>We need John and Mary for political muscle.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>I don't think you do, but I recognize you're in a tough spot.</p><p></p><p>CALDWELL</p><p>I'm not looking for a holy war, Leo.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Oh, I know you're not, Al.

[They stop walking to face one another.]</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>CALDWELL</p><p>It was not a little deal.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>No one's saying...</p><p></p><p>CALDWELL</p><p>And I want to make sure -- of nothing else, I want to make sure that you're</p><p>taking</p><p>me seriously.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>You don't think we're taking this seriously? 24 hours ago, the President</p><p>ordered</p><p>me to fire Josh Lyman.

[walks around the table]</p><p>My name</p><p>is Sam Seaborn and I'm the Deputy Communications Director. What does that mean</p><p>exactly? Well, to begin with, I'm a counselor to the President, mostly</p><p>on domestic</p><p>matters, though generally not security related. I work with Toby Ziegler, the</p><p>Communications Director; and C.J. Cregg, the Press Secretary, on crafting our</p><p>message and getting it out through the electronic and print media. And while my</p><p>functions here are generally perceived to be politically skewed, it's</p><p>important to</p><p>remember that it is not the D.N.C., but rather your tax dollars that pay</p><p>my salary.</p><p>So I work for you whether you voted for us or not.</p><p></p><p>There's an awkward silence in the room before--</p><p></p><p>MALLORY</p><p>Mr. Seaborn, maybe you could give us some history.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Sure.

[pause] The White House, as you know, was built several years</p><p>ago. Mostly, if</p><p>I'm not mistaken, out of cement. The room we're in right now, the Roosevelt</p><p>Room,</p><p>is very famous. It is named for our 18th President, Franklin Delano</p><p>Roosevelt. The</p><p>chairs that you're sitting on today were fashioned from the lumber of a</p><p>pirate ship</p><p>captured during the Spanish-American--</p><p></p><p>The students are enraptured, but Mallory becomes upset.</p><p></p><p>MALLORY</p><p>[stands] All right.

Grant, and the Roosevelt Room was named</p><p>for Theodore.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Really?</p><p></p><p>MALLORY</p><p>There's like a six-foot painting on the wall of Teddy Roosevelt.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>I should've put two and two together.</p><p></p><p>MALLORY</p><p>Yes.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Look, the thing is, while there are really a great many things I can speak with</p><p>authority, I'm not good at talking about the White House.</p><p></p><p>MALLORY</p><p>You're the White House Deputy Communications Director and you're not good</p><p>at talking</p><p>about the White House?</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Ironic, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>MALLORY</p><p>I don't believe this. [starts to go back into the room, but Sam stops her]</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Wait a minute. Wait. Please. Could you do me favor? Could you tell me which</p><p>one of</p><p>those kids is Leo McGarry's daughter?</p><p></p><p>MALLORY</p><p>Why?</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Well, if I could make eye contact with her, make her laugh, you know, just</p><p>see that</p><p>she has a good time, it might go a long way toward making my life easier.</p><p></p><p>MALLORY</p><p>These children worked hard.

I just found out the Times is publishing</p><p>a poll</p><p>that says a considerable portion of Americans feel that the White House</p><p>has lost</p><p>energy and focus. A perception that's not likely to be altered by the</p><p>video footage</p><p>of the President riding his bicycle into a tree. As we speak, the Coast</p><p>Guard are</p><p>fishing Cubans out of the Atlantic Ocean while the Governor of Florida wants to</p><p>blockade the Port of Miami. A good friend of mine's about to get fired for</p><p>going on</p><p>television and making sense, and it turns out I accidentally slept with</p><p>a prostitute</p><p>last night. Now. Would you please, in the name of compassion, tell me which</p><p>one of</p><p>those kids is my boss's daughter.</p><p></p><p>MALLORY</p><p>That would be me.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>You.</p><p></p><p>MALLORY</p><p>Yes.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Leo's daughter's fourth grade class.</p><p></p><p>MALLORY</p><p>Yes.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>[pause] Well, this is bad on so many levels.</p><p></p><p>FADE OUT.</p><p>END ACT THREE</p><p>* * *</p><p></p><p>ACT FOUR</p><p></p><p>FADE IN: INT.

Now,</p><p>yesterday morning, on the television program Capital Beat, that contempt</p><p>was given</p><p>a voice... and a face... and a name.

It is up to you, Al. You, know, my wife, Abbey, she never wants me to do anything while I'm upset. [a staffer hands him coffee] Thank you, Mr. Lewis. 28 years ago, I come home from a very bad day at the State House. I tell Abbey I'm going out for a drive. I get in the station wagon, and put it in reverse, and pull out of the garage full speed. [Leo and Sam appear in the doorway and quietly enter into the room.] Except I forgot to open the garage door.</p><p></p><p>Bartlet pauses to take a drink of his coffee and smile at Josh, who smiles back</p><p>uncomfortably.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET [cont.]</p><p>Abbey told me to not drive while I was upset and she was right. She was right yesterday when she told me not to get on that damn bicycle while I was upset, but I did it anyway, and I guess I was just about as angry as I've ever been in my life. It seems my granddaughter, Annie, had given an interview in one of the teen magazines. And somewhere between movie stars and make-up tips, she talked about her feelings on a woman's right to choose. Now Annie, all of 12, has always been precocious, but she's got a good head on her shoulders and I like it when she uses it, so I couldn't understand it when her mother called me in tears yesterday. I said, Elizabeth, what's wrong? She said, It's Annie. Now I love my family and I've read my bible from cover to cover so I want you to tell me, from what part of the Holy Scripture do you suppose the Lambs of God drew their Divine inspiration when they sent my 12 year-old granddaughter a Raggedy Ann doll with a knife stuck through its throat? [pause] You'll denounce these people, Al. You'll do it publicly. And until you do, you can all get your fat asses out of my White House. [Everyone is frozen.] C.J., show these people out.</p><p></p><p>MARY MARSH</p><p>I believe we can find the door.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>Find it now.</p><p></p><p>The group leaves the room quickly and quietly.</p><p></p><p>CALDWELL</p><p>[quietly to Leo] We'll fix this, Leo.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>See that you do.</p><p></p><p>Bartlet has gone out the side door, through an adjoining room and into THE</p><p>OVAL OFFICE.</p><p>The staff begins recovering from this last moment and following the President.</p><p></p><p>JOSH</p><p>Okay, can I just say that, as it turned out, I was the calmest person in</p><p>the room?</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>Hey...</p><p></p><p>C.J.</p><p>Way to stay cool.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>I am not empowered to auction off the Bill of Rights.</p><p></p><p>JOSH</p><p>I thought you were going to take a swing at her there.</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>She was calling us New York Jews, Josh.</p><p></p><p>JOSH</p><p>Yeah, but being from Connecticut, I didn't mind so much. [They enter the Oval Office.] You, C.J., on the other hand, were brilliant. I particularly liked the part where you said nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>C.J.</p><p>I'm sorry, Josh, I was distracted. All I could really think about was</p><p>Lloyd Russell and your girlfriend.</p><p></p><p>SAM</p><p>Mandy and Lloyd Russell?</p><p></p><p>JOSH</p><p>I'll be puttin' an end to that.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>Hello, Mr. President. Did you have a nice trip, sir? How's the ankle, sir? Seems to me we've all been taking a little break. Thinking about our personal lives or thinking about keeping our jobs. Breaks are good. It's not a bad idea taking a break every now and then. I know how hard you all work.</p><p></p><p>MARGARET, Leo's secretary, brings Leo a note, which he slips to Bartlet after reading it.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>[speaks while reading the note] There was this time that Annie came to me with this press clipping. Seems these theologians down in South America were very excited because this little girl from Chile had sliced open a tomato, and the inside flesh of this tomato had actually formed a perfect Rosary. The theologians commented that they thought this was a very impressive girl. Annie commented that she thought it was a very impressive tomato. I don't know what made me think of that. [reporting the information from the slip of paper] Naval Intelligence reports approximately 1200 Cubans left Havana this morning. Approximately 700 turned back due to severe weather, some 350 are missing and presumed dead, 137 have been taken into custody in Miami and are seeking asylum. [pause] With the clothes on their backs, they came through a storm. And the ones that didn't die want a better life. And they want it here. Talk about impressive. My point is this: Break's over.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Thank you, Mr. President.</p><p></p><p>The senior staff say their thanks and begin to leave the office. Josh is</p><p>the last</p><p>to the door.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>Josh. Too busy being indicted for tax fraud? [beat] Don't ever do it again.</p><p></p><p>JOSH</p><p>[quietly] Yes sir.

ERICA (V.O.): That can’t possibly be true.       MARK (V.O.): It is.       ERICA (V.O.): What would account for that?       MARK (V.O.): Well, first, an awful lot of people live in China. But here’s my question:FADE IN:INT. CAMPUS BAR - NIGHTMARK ZUCKERBERG is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of any physically intimidating attributes masks a very complicated and dangerous anger. He has trouble making eye contact and sometimes it’s hard to tell if he’s talking to you or to himself.ERICA, also 19, is Mark’s date. She has a girl-next-door face that makes her easy to fall for. At this point in the conversation she already knows that she’d rather not be there and her politeness is about to be tested.The scene is stark and simple.       MARK: How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SAT’s?       ERICA: I didn’t know they take SAT’s in China.       MARK: They don’t. I wasn’t talking about China anymore, I was talking about me.       ERICA: You got 1600?       MARK: Yes. I could sing in an a Capella group, but I can’t sing.       ERICA: Does that mean you actually got nothing wrong?       MARK: I can row crew or invent a 25 dollar PC.       ERICA: Or you can get into a final club.       MARK: Or I can get into a final club.       ERICA: You know, from a woman’s perspective, sometimes not singing in an a Capella group is a good thing?       MARK: This is serious.       ERICA: On the other hand I do like guys who row crew.       MARK: (beat) Well I can’t do that.       ERICA: I was kid--       MARK: Yes, it means I got nothing wrong on the test.       ERICA: Have you ever tried?       MARK: I’m trying right now.       ERICA: To row crew?       MARK: To get into a final club. To row crew? No. Are you, like--whatever--delusional?       ERICA: Maybe, but sometimes you say two things at once and I’m not sure which one I’m supposed to be aiming at.       MARK: But you’ve seen guys who row crew, right?       ERICA: No.       MARK: Okay, well they’re bigger than me. They’re world class athletes. And a second ago you said you like guys who row crew so I assumed you had met one.       ERICA: I guess I just meant I liked the idea of it. The way a girl likes cowboys.       MARK: (beat) Okay.       ERICA: Should we get something to eat?       MARK: Would you like to talk about something else?       ERICA: No, it’s just since the beginning of the conversation about finals club I think I may have missed a birthday.(can’t get over it)There are really more people in China with genius IQ’s than the entire population of--       MARK: The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt punched the Porc.       ERICA: Which one?       MARK: The Porcellian, the Porc, it’s the best of the best.       ERICA: Which Roosevelt?       MARK: Theodore.       ERICA: Is it true that they send a bus around to pick up girls who want to party with the next Fed Chairman?       MARK: You can see why it’s so important to get in.       ERICA: Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into?MARK is visibly hit by that...       MARK: Why would you ask me that?       ERICA: I’m just asking.       MARK: None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.       ERICA: Must be nice. He made $300,000 in a summer?       MARK: He likes meteorology.       ERICA: You said it was oil futures.       MARK: You can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that’s easiest to get into is the one where I’ll have the best chance.       ERICA: I asked--what?       MARK: You asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that that’s the one where I’ll have the best chance.       ERICA: The one that’s the easiest to get into would be the one where anybody has the best chance.       MARK: You didn’t ask me which one was the best one, you asked me which one was the easiest one.       ERICA: I was honestly just asking. Okay? I was just asking to ask. Mark, I’m not speaking in code.       MARK: Erica--       ERICA: You’re obsessed with finals clubs. You have finals clubs OCD and you need to see someone about it who’ll prescribe you some sort of medication. You don’t care if the side effects may include blindness.       MARK: Final clubs. Not finals clubs and there’s a difference between being obsessed and being motivated.       ERICA: Yes there is.       MARK: Well you do--that was cryptic--so you do speak in code.       ERICA: I didn’t mean to be cryptic.       MARK: I’m saying I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs.       ERICA: Why?       MARK: Because they’re exclusive. And fun and they lead to a better life.       ERICA: Teddy Roosevelt didn’t get elected president because he was a member of the Phoenix Club.       MARK: He was a member of the Porcellian and yes he did.       ERICA: Well why don’t you just concentrate on being the best you you can be?       MARK: Did you really just say that?       ERICA: (beat) I was kidding.(MORE) Although just because something’s trite it doesn’t make it any less--       MARK: I want to try to be straight forward with you and tell you that I think you might want to be a little more supportive. If I get in I’ll be taking you...to the events, and the gatherings...and you’ll be meeting a lot of people you wouldn’t normally get to meet.       ERICA: (smiles)You would do that for me?       MARK: We’re dating.       ERICA: Okay, well I want to try and be straight forward with you and let you know that we’re not anymore.       MARK: What do you mean?       ERICA: We’re not dating anymore, I’m sorry.       MARK: Is this a joke?       ERICA: No, it’s not.       MARK: You’re breaking up with me?       ERICA: You’re going to introduce me to people I wouldn’t normally have the chance to meet? What the fff--What is that supposed to mean?       MARK: Wait, settle down.       ERICA: What is it supposed to mean?       MARK: Erica, the reason we’re able to sit here and drink right now is cause you used to sleep with the door guy.       ERICA: The door guy, his name is Bobby. I did not slept with the door guy, the door guy is a friend of mine. He’s a perfectly good class of people and what part of Long Island are you from--Wimbledon?       MARK: Wait--       ERICA: I’m going back to my dorm.       MARK: Wait, wait, is this real?       ERICA: Yes.       MARK: Okay, then wait. I apologize, okay?       ERICA: I have to go study.       MARK: Erica--       ERICA: Yeah.       MARK: I’m sorry, I mean it.       ERICA: I appreciate that but--       MARK: Come on.       ERICA: --I have to study.       MARK: You don’t have to study. You don’t have to study. Let’s just talk.       ERICA: I can’t.       MARK: Why?       ERICA: Because it’s exhausting. Dating you is like dating a stairmaster.       MARK: All I meant is that you’re not likely to--currently--I wasn’t making a comment on your parents--I was just saying you go to B.U., I was stating a fact, that’s all, and if it seemed rude then of course I apologize.       ERICA: I have to go study.       MARK: You don’t have to study.       ERICA: Why do you keep saying I don’t have to study?!       MARK: Because you go to B.U.!ERICA stares at him...       MARK (CONT’D): (pause) Do you want to get some food?       ERICA: I’m sorry you’re not sufficiently impressed with my education.       MARK: And I’m sorry I don’t have a rowboat so we’re even.       ERICA: I think we should just be friends.       MARK: I don’t want friends.       ERICA: I was being polite, I have no intention of being friends with you.       MARK: I’m under some pressure right now with my OS class and if we could just order food I think we should--ERICA takes MARK’s hand and looks at him tenderly...       ERICA: (close) You are probably going to be a very successful computer person.(MORE)But you’re going to go through life thinking that girls don’t like you because you’re a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won’t be true. It’ll be because you’re an asshole.And with that stinger, ERICA walks off we slowly push in on MARK.

(pause) For thelawyers, for thepress, for the mess, for the fear. Bruno, Doug, Connie: these guys aregood. They wantto win. So do we. The only thing we want more is to be right. I wonder ifyou can't doboth. The staff are all standing very still, listening intently to his words.Bartlet slowly stands up.BARTLETThere's a new book, and we're gonna write it. You can win if you run a smart,disciplinedcampaign, if you studiously say nothing -- nothing that causes you trouble,nothingthat's a gaffe, nothing that shows you might think the wrong thing, nothingthat showsyou think. But it just isn't worthy of us, is it, Toby?TOBYNo, sir.BARTLETIt isn't worthy of us, it isn't worthy of America, it isn't worthy of agreat nation.We're gonna write a new book, right here, right now.

OnlyCharliefollows him. The rest of the staff wait for Bartlet to leave. Just as hereaches thedoorway, he stops and hesitates. He hears Abbey say his name. And then heturns aroundto face them.BARTLETYou know what? Break's over.Bartlet turns and walks out through the hallway to the podium where Abbeyis standing,waiting for him, clapping along with the crowd. The cheers and applause havegottenvery loud.

That's all. I'll see you out there.</p><p></p><p>C.J. looks a bit dismayed and frustrated. She turns and slowly walks away,</p><p>but then stops</p><p>and turns back around to face him.

C.J. slowly turns away from him, but seems to</p><p>hesitate,</p><p>not sure if she should leave or say something else. Bartlet stares at her</p><p>for several</p><p>long moments.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>(gently) I was never supposed to win.</p><p></p><p>C.J. turns around to look at him.

C.J., they need you.</p><p></p><p>C.J. turns back to look at Bartlet, with a pained expression on her face,</p><p>the anger gone.</p><p>He stares at her for several moments.

SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY</p><p>The band is playing and the crowd is cheering as Secret Service agents make</p><p>last minute</p><p>preparations onstage for the President's arrival. In a classroom off the</p><p>hallway, the</p><p>campaign staff, Doug, Bruno and Connie, are meeting with the regular staff</p><p>including</p><p>Donna, Charlie, Sam, Josh and Toby. Leo and Josh are pacing, while most of</p><p>the others</p><p>are leaning or sitting on the desks. Bruno is standing in the back of the</p><p>room.</p><p>They're arguing about the speech. As they argue, the cheering and applause</p><p>continue</p><p>outside. The introductory speeches have started.</p><p></p><p>DOUG</p><p>(reading) ...to fall victim to torpor and timidity.

Even Bruno looks annoyed.</p><p></p><p>DOUG</p><p>(louder, more exasperated) I know what the word means. I'm saying if people</p><p>don't know</p><p>what the word means...</p><p></p><p>Bartlet walks in briskly through a door behind Doug.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>They can look it up!</p><p></p><p>Everyone, including Doug, stands. Bartlet stops and stands next to the</p><p>teacher's desk</p><p>at the front of the room.</p><p></p><p>EVERYONE</p><p>Good morning, Mr. President.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>It's not our job to appeal to the lowest common denominator, Doug.

If you're going to be the Education President, it'd be nice not to</p><p>hide that you</p><p>have an education.</p><p></p><p>Abbey's voice can barely be heard as she starts her speech. Bartlet points</p><p>at Bruno and</p><p>gestures politely to Doug to leave.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>Bruno, would you mind?</p><p></p><p>Bruno nods. He, Doug and Connie quietly leave the room. As the door opens,</p><p>the staff</p><p>can hear a bit of Abbey speaking and the crowd applauding and cheering.</p><p></p><p>ABBEY (VO)</p><p>...of being elected Governor of his home state.</p><p></p><p>Bruno and his colleagues close the door, returning the room to relative</p><p>silence.</p><p>Bartlet sighs and casually leans against the desk. There's a portrait of</p><p>Abraham</p><p>Lincoln on the wall. Leo and Charlie are standing somberly behind him.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>Churchill and FDR: serious men using big words for big purpose.</p><p></p><p>Bartlet stops and pauses for several moments, like he's changing his mind</p><p>about what to</p><p>say. The staff look at him patiently and expectantly, like they're anticipating</p><p>an</p><p>inspiring lecture. He sighs, then speaks with great emotion.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>It occurs to me, I never said I'm sorry. (pause) I am. (pause) For the</p><p>lawyers, for the</p><p>press, for the mess, for the fear. Bruno, Doug, Connie: these guys are</p><p>good. They want</p><p>to win. So do we. The only thing we want more is to be right. I wonder if</p><p>you can't do</p><p>both. The staff are all standing very still, listening intently to his words.</p><p></p><p>Bartlet slowly stands up.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>There's a new book, and we're gonna write it. You can win if you run a smart,</p><p>disciplined</p><p>campaign, if you studiously say nothing -- nothing that causes you trouble,</p><p>nothing</p><p>that's a gaffe, nothing that shows you might think the wrong thing, nothing</p><p>that shows</p><p>you think. But it just isn't worthy of us, is it, Toby?</p><p></p><p>TOBY</p><p>No, sir.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>It isn't worthy of us, it isn't worthy of America, it isn't worthy of a</p><p>great nation.</p><p>We're gonna write a new book, right here, right now. This very moment. Today.</p><p></p><p>The staff look more determined, especially C.J. An aide opens the door</p><p>leading out to</p><p>the hallway and the podium. C.J. turns at the sound of the door opening. Once</p><p>again,</p><p>they can hear Abbey speaking.</p><p></p><p>ABBEY (VO)</p><p>And so, my friends...</p><p></p><p>AIDE</p><p>Sir?</p><p></p><p>Bartlet nods at the aide, then looks back at Leo and Charlie.

Only</p><p>Charlie</p><p>follows him. The rest of the staff wait for Bartlet to leave. Just as he</p><p>reaches the</p><p>doorway, he stops and hesitates. He hears Abbey say his name. And then he</p><p>turns around</p><p>to face them.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>You know what? Break's over.</p><p></p><p>Bartlet turns and walks out through the hallway to the podium where Abbey</p><p>is standing,</p><p>waiting for him, clapping along with the crowd. The cheers and applause have</p><p>gotten</p><p>very loud. When Bartlet reaches the podium, he kisses Abbey and then he</p><p>turns to wave</p><p>to the crowd. C.J., Josh, Sam, Toby and Leo emerge onto the podium, one by</p><p>one, and</p><p>assemble themselves behind Bartlet. They clap along with the crowd. Donna</p><p>and Charlie</p><p>hang back by the doorway, clapping.</p><p></p><p>DISSOLVE TO: END TITLES.</p><p>FADE TO BLACK.</p><p>THE END</p>"

C.J.!C.J.Joan.Carl asks a follow up question, despite C.J.'s attempt to call on someoneelse.

Thereporters stare at her, astonished. Toby looks stunned, his eyebrows raisedand his mouthhanging open. It take a moment for C.J. to realize the scope of herblunder.

Theyslowly walktoward it as they talk.SAMHe's relieved...he might have to put American lives at risk and killHaitian civilians'cause it takes his mind off having lied to the electorate?As they reach the briefing room exit door, the door opens and C.J. walksout into thehallway amid the sound of reporters calling out her name. Only half lookingup, she takesone step in the direction of her office, sees Toby and Sam, and immediatelyturns to walkin the opposite direction so she's not facing them. She looks deflated,not quite steadyon her feet, and extremely upset. They can see how upset she is, so theyhang back.TOBY[gently] C.J...C.J. stops in a doorway.C.J.[shouting] Just... just don't say anything for a... just don't say anythingfor a....C.J. puts her hand to her head and sighs heavily, muttering somethinginaudible toherself. Sam looks over at Toby, then back at C.J. None of them make a soundfor severalmoments. Then C.J. pounds her hand into the wall.C.J.[shouting] Dammit!C.J. turns around and walks between Toby and Sam, who say nothing in responseto heroutburst.

The President's relieved to be focusing on Haiti?TOBYI was there.JOSHIsn't this exactly what we said we had to be careful of?Leo comes barreling down the HALLWAY toward them. They all stop and standin a circle inthe middle of the hall. A security officer is standing, still and silent,right behindLeo. Toby bites his nails. Josh rubs his head in frustration. Sam stilllooks stunned,as does Leo.LEOWhat happened?JOSHShe was asked if the President's situation makes it harder for him to focuson Haiti.SAM[defensively] There was a ramp-up.JOSHThere was a ramp-up but she was asked...LEOWhat did she say?JOSHShe said the President's relieved to be focusing on something that matters.LEORelieved?Leo turns, fuming and shaking his head, and walks back toward his office. Theotherthree follow close behind, debating their options amongst themselves.TOBYWe can argue that...uh...she just misspoke.JOSHShe meant to say that the President realizes he's focusing on something thatmatters.TOBYOr the President's reiterating that his focus is on something...SAMI don't like something that matters, like finding out the President lieddoesn't matter.They all walk into LEO'S OFFICE and keep on talking as Leo methodically andangrily slamsthe door between his office and the Oval Office.TOBYShe misspoke is all we need.

Samtries tomaintain a non-aggressive tone with Leo.SAMWe haven't had much time...LEO[sharply] You had a week. How much time do you need?SAM[finally raising his voice, angry] Some of us have had more time than others!Leo stops cold and stares at Sam. No one speaks for several moments. Tobygazes at theceiling.

If weannounce in twoweeks, that's when the first round of subpoenas will be handed down! [testily]Screw it!It's game time. Let's go!Leo stares at him for a few moments, silent, but continues walking. Bartletwalks aheadto a fence that borders a huge expanse of land.LEOThis is a nice piece of land. It'd be better without the... floodlights andthe metaldetectors, but...Bartlet leans against the fence and stares out at the cows grazing near alarge pond.Finally, Leo walks up to the fence and leans against it, a few feet awayfrom Bartlet,and looks out at the land.BARTLETYeah.Leo turns, still leaning on the fence, to look at Bartlet.LEOAbbey and the girls are getting in this morning?BARTLET[not looking at Leo] Yeah. [finally turns, still leaning on the fence,to face Leo]How's everybody doing?LEO[nods] Fine.BARTLET[nods slightly, but looks skeptical] What about C.J.?Leo gives Bartlet a knowing look, but doesn't say anything in response.

The</p><p>reporters stare at her, astonished. Toby looks stunned, his eyebrows raised</p><p>and his mouth</p><p>hanging open. It take a moment for C.J. to realize the scope of her</p><p>blunder.

Then C.J. pounds her hand into the wall.</p><p></p><p>C.J.</p><p>[shouting] Dammit!</p><p></p><p>C.J. turns around and walks between Toby and Sam, who say nothing in response</p><p>to her</p><p>outburst.

DRIVEWAY OF THE BARTLET FAMILY FARM - PRESENT DAY</p><p>A black Lincoln drives up a long gravel driveway which is flanked by a wooden</p><p>fence and</p><p>some trees. Several black SUVs and a few cars are parked along the side of</p><p>the drive.</p><p>A large white house is barely visible in the distance. The car stops at a</p><p>guardhouse.</p><p>Leo is sitting in the backseat, with the window rolled down.</p><p></p><p>GUARD</p><p>Good morning, Mr. McGarry. You can go on up. He's out by the pasture.</p><p></p><p>Leo nods and the car creeps forward up the driveway.</p><p></p><p>CUT TO: EXT. PASTURE ON BARTLET FAMILY FARM - CONTINUOUS</p><p>Bartlet is leaning on the back of an old red pickup, wearing jeans and a</p><p>polo shirt,</p><p>drinking coffee and smoking. He catches sight of Leo's car. Several barns</p><p>and out</p><p>buildings, as well as farm equipment are visible off to the side. A cow moos</p><p>in the</p><p>background. Leo's driver pulls the car up close to where Bartlet is</p><p>standing. Leo gets</p><p>out of the car and walks over toward Bartlet as someone walks two horses up</p><p>toward the</p><p>house. Leo is wearing khakis and a casual suit jacket.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>[shaking his head] You live in the middle of nowhere, you know that?</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>Awasiwi Odanack.

I don't give a...</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>It will. Plus it gives meat to the right. Lets the press write a process</p><p>story. Right out</p><p>of the gate the Bartlet campaign is pandering and bumbling and performing</p><p>abortions in</p><p>the Rose Garden.</p><p></p><p>Leo finally catches up to Bartlet so that they're walking beside each other.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>Screw it, and screw anybody who writes that story.</p><p></p><p>Leo looks down at the ground for a moment, then continues in a slightly</p><p>softer tone.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Plus, I have a hunch the first round of subpoenas'll be handed down this week.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>[smiles slightly] You have a hunch?</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Look...</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>Of course the first round of subpoenas'll be handed down this week. If we</p><p>announce in two</p><p>weeks, that's when the first round of subpoenas will be handed down! [testily]</p><p>Screw it!</p><p>It's game time. Let's go!</p><p></p><p>Leo stares at him for a few moments, silent, but continues walking. Bartlet</p><p>walks ahead</p><p>to a fence that borders a huge expanse of land.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>This is a nice piece of land. It'd be better without the... floodlights and</p><p>the metal</p><p>detectors, but...</p><p></p><p>Bartlet leans against the fence and stares out at the cows grazing near a</p><p>large pond.</p><p>Finally, Leo walks up to the fence and leans against it, a few feet away</p><p>from Bartlet,</p><p>and looks out at the land.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>Yeah.</p><p></p><p>Leo turns, still leaning on the fence, to look at Bartlet.</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>Abbey and the girls are getting in this morning?</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>[not looking at Leo] Yeah. [finally turns, still leaning on the fence,</p><p>to face Leo]</p><p>How's everybody doing?</p><p></p><p>LEO</p><p>[nods] Fine.</p><p></p><p>BARTLET</p><p>[nods slightly, but looks skeptical] What about C.J.?</p><p></p><p>Leo gives Bartlet a knowing look, but doesn't say anything in response.

زيطة ، لقينا احلى صيدة- مش غزال بس تشبيه الغاب ؛ لانك لبوة بكيفك- إتشرمطت . ليه بس إتصرفت ب غلطة ناتجة لغيظك- ده مش سايفر ، ده فيلم خمس زنوج على واحدة بيضة- و جايبة صحابها للسهرة ، القحبة و كيفها- او عشان من جواها عارفة ان صحابها احسن منها- ف الاول و الاخر شراميط ، هما جابوه لنفسهم- فا محدش احسن من حد فيهم ، هيتناكوا كلهم- محمود رمح طاعنك ، جرح موس لورد اعمق- سهل تموت مش صعبة ، بس يا دوب اقص شعرك- بان ع البيت يا اوس ضعفك ، مش عارف تمشى ع البيت- زى زمان . كبر ف السن و عجز ، بقى اوس اعرج- فا يا اوس خد بعضك ، ده لو اتبقى بعضاً منك- فاهم ، مش قادر تعمل الى بنعمله . صعبة ف سنك- كله صعب ماعادا حاجة و هى انى مش صعب اذلك- مؤسس فاشل و لعبته احنا الى مصعدينها- بسببه انقرض جيل ، قلمه اتضرب بيه- بقول لشرى عاش يا وحش ، خيرى غير معترف بيه- اتشرف بيك ، ف الزبالة مع تراكاتك و اجمعكوا- و إقفل عليكوا بلاعة الشارع ، انتوا خرة السين- اراب لييج ، ايجى راب سكول ، خليفةR.I.P- واى كرو ، سى سى جى . و ذكرهم الغرض فيه- اقول دول الجيل القديم الى سابوا بصمة تقيلة- اما انت الناس بتقول مين اسامة عشان كنت اضعف جيلك- الى بعدوا ييجوا ، إبداعكوا زيرو ، دوشة كعبوا بيكوا- كبيركوا بيدعم الشواذ ، فا مستغربتش دعموا ليكوا- ليكوا شرف ، المواجهة و احييكوا بفرح- لما توفروا كومنتاتكوا الجامدة لاغانيكوا الخرة- ستار واحد بس كافى لو هندى لاوسRate- نملة ، سمنة . جنة اه جنة ، هيكتور اوس اتنين- لما تجمع عجوز مخنث لبوة و تسعينى عاطل- يبقى تاريخكوا ده تلفوه لا مؤاخذة تجيبوا بيه جيلاطى",

I have been serving the Sixers at your pleasure for the past 34 months. Atul Gawande, a Surgeon at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, remains (from afar) one of my favorite reads. He laughs that reading scientific studies has long been a guilty pleasure. Reading investor letters has long been one of mine.What I hope to accomplish here is to give you insight into what has transpired behind the scenes in ways you might not have otherwise heard about. Many of you attended our most recent board meeting in New York, where many of these topics were addressed. But for all twelve of you, I hope that this provides a deeper look into what you have at your organization. Accordingly, you should anticipate some mild cheerleading (of others) sprinkled with a healthy dose of self-flagellation about things I’ve done wrong.There has been much criticism of our approach. There will be more. A competitive league like the NBA necessitates a zig while our competitors comfortably zag. We often chose not to defend ourselves against much of the criticism, largely in an effort to stay true to the ideal of having the longest view in the room. To attempt to convince others that our actions are just will serve to paint us in a different light among some of our competitors as progressives worth emulating, versus adversaries worthy of their disdain. Call me old-fashioned, but sometimes the optimal place for your light is hiding directly under a bushel.Lastly, this letter will only speak to the part of the business that I’m today’s steward of: the basketball team and its attendant operations. With Scott O’Neil running our business operations, you are in good hands. I can assure you that when your team is eventually able to compete deep into May, Scott will ably and efficiently separate the good people of the Delaware Valley from their wallets on your behalf.Worry not.A league with 30 intense competitors requires a culture of finding new, better ways to solve repeating problems. In the short term, investing in that sort of innovation often doesn’t look like much progress, if any. Abraham Lincoln said “give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.”In May of 1969, a 38-year-old Warren Buffett sat down at a typewriter to inform his investors that he was closing his fund (then Buffett Partnership). His reason: market conditions were such that he no longer had the requisite confidence that he could make good decisions on behalf of the investors and deliver on his commitments to them. So he would stop investing on their behalf.For me, that’s today. Given all the changes to our organization, I no longer have the confidence that I can make good decisions on behalf of investors in the Sixers—you. So I should step down. And I have.In one sense, it pains me that it has come to this and that I would go at the end of a particularly down year in the standings, one that has been painful for all of us. But the fact is—and a young Buffett said it much better than I ever could—“I am not attuned to this environment, and I don’t want to spoil a decent record by trying to play a game I don’t understand just so I can go out a hero.”Yup.Thinking about thinkingI admire Seth Klarman a great deal. I am consistently impressed by his conviction and humility, a rare combination. About their approach at Baupost, he says, “it isn’t the only way of thinking, but it’s how we approach it.” Below is some insight into a few things we value and how we’ve approached decision making at the Sixers.First, this list is anything but exhaustive, and hardly mine alone. Whenever possible, I think crosspollinating ideas from other contexts is far, far better than attempting to solve our problems in basketball as if no one has ever faced anything similar. Accordingly, this approach comes from a frequent search into behavioral economics, cognitive science, and a lot of observation and trial and error over my 11 years in the NBA. And mistakes. Lots and lots of mistakes.To begin, let’s stand on the shoulders of Charlie Munger, a giant to me. He is a man that’s been thinking about thinking longer than I’ve been alive. Let’s start with him and his approach. His two-part technique is:1. First, what are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered?2. Second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain at a subconscious level is automatically doing these things—which by and large are useful, but which often malfunctions?To do this requires you to divorce process from outcome. You can be right for the wrong reasons. In our business, you’re often lionized for it. You can be wrong for the right reasons. This may well prove to be Joel Embiid. There is signal everywhere that Joel is unique, from the practice gyms in Lawrence, Kansas to Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania to Doha, Qatar where he does something awe inspiring far too regularly. We remain hopeful (and optimistic) about his long-term playing career, but we don’t yet know exactly how it will turn out. The decision to draft Joel third, though, still looks to me to be the correct one in hindsight given the underlying reasoning. But to call something that could be wrong (“failed draft pick”) right (“good decision”) makes all of our heads hurt, mine included.So we have to look deeper at process. Here’s a go at it:(I would be dismayed if you don’t see pockets of this kind of thinking throughout the organization. In fact, I will feel like I’ve let you down.)The importance of intellectual humilityLifelong learning is where it’s at. To walk down that path requires a deep-seated humility about a) what’s knowable, and b) what each of us know. We hire for this aggressively. We celebrate this internally. And we’ve been known to punish when we find it woefully lacking.We talk a great deal about being curious, not critical. About asking the question until you understand something truly. About not being afraid to ask the obvious question that everyone else seems to know the answer to. And about the willingness to say three simple words, “I don’t know.”Tesla’s Elon Musk describes his everyday stance as, “You should take the approach that you’re wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong.” The physicist James Clerk Maxwell described it as a “thoroughly conscious ignorance—the prelude to every real advance in science.” Bill James of the Boston Red Sox (and, I might add, a Kansas basketball expert) added a little flair when asked whether the learnings available via examining evidence were exhausted: “we’ve only taken a bucket of knowledge from a sea of ignorance.”A way to prop up this kind of humility is to keep score. Use a decision journal. Write in your own words what you think will happen and why before a decision. Refer back to it later. See if you were right, and for the right reasons (think Bill Belichick’s famous 4th down decision against Indianapolis in 2009 which summarizes to: good decision, didn’t work). Reading your own past reasoning in your own words in your own handwriting time after time causes the tides of humility to gather at your feet. I’m often in waist-deep water here.The other reason to keep track yourself is you’re often the only one to see the most insidious type of errors, the ones the narrative generating parts of our lizard brains storytell their way around—errors of omission. You don’t have a wobbly understanding of just the things you got wrong, but the things you got right but not right enough. Listen to Charlie Munger talk about how he and Berkshire Hathaway should be measured not by their success, but by how much more successful they would have been if they bought more of something: “We should have bought more Coke.”The necessity of innovationInvesting in disruptive innovation doesn’t ferment misunderstanding, it necessitates it. Jeff Bezos says it this way: “There are a few prerequisites to inventing…You have to be willing to fail. You have to be willing to think long-term. You have to be willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time.”A yearning for innovation requires real exploration. It requires a persistent search to try (and fail) to move your understanding forward with a new tool, a new technique, a new insight. Sadly, the first innovation often isn’t even all that helpful, but may well provide a path to ones that are. This is an idea that Steven Johnson of Where Good Ideas Come From popularized called the “adjacent possible.” Where finding your way through a labyrinth of ignorance requires you to first open a door into a room of understanding, one that by its very existence has new doors to new rooms with deeper insights lurking behind them.In most endeavors, it’s fine to be content to woodshed until you get something near perfect. You want that to be you. Grit matters. But it won’t be long until some innovation makes all that effort newly obsolete. You want that to be you, too.",

And we’ve been known to punish when we find it woefully lacking.</p><p></p><p>We talk a great deal about being curious, not critical. About asking the question until you understand something truly. About not being afraid to ask the obvious question that everyone else seems to know the answer to. And about the willingness to say three simple words, “I don’t know.”</p><p></p><p>Tesla’s Elon Musk describes his everyday stance as, “You should take the approach that you’re wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong.” The physicist James Clerk Maxwell described it as a “thoroughly conscious ignorance—the prelude to every real advance in science.” Bill James of the Boston Red Sox (and, I might add, a Kansas basketball expert) added a little flair when asked whether the learnings available via examining evidence were exhausted: “we’ve only taken a bucket of knowledge from a sea of ignorance.”</p><p></p><p>A way to prop up this kind of humility is to keep score. Use a decision journal. Write in your own words what you think will happen and why before a decision. Refer back to it later. See if you were right, and for the right reasons (think Bill Belichick’s famous 4th down decision against Indianapolis in 2009 which summarizes to: good decision, didn’t work). Reading your own past reasoning in your own words in your own handwriting time after time causes the tides of humility to gather at your feet. I’m often in waist-deep water here.</p><p></p><p>The other reason to keep track yourself is you’re often the only one to see the most insidious type of errors, the ones the narrative generating parts of our lizard brains storytell their way around—errors of omission. You don’t have a wobbly understanding of just the things you got wrong, but the things you got right but not right enough. Listen to Charlie Munger talk about how he and Berkshire Hathaway should be measured not by their success, but by how much more successful they would have been if they bought more of something: “We should have bought more Coke.”</p><p></p><p>The necessity of innovation</p><p>Investing in disruptive innovation doesn’t ferment misunderstanding, it necessitates it. Jeff Bezos says it this way: “There are a few prerequisites to inventing…You have to be willing to fail. You have to be willing to think long-term. You have to be willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time.”</p><p></p><p>A yearning for innovation requires real exploration. It requires a persistent search to try (and fail) to move your understanding forward with a new tool, a new technique, a new insight. Sadly, the first innovation often isn’t even all that helpful, but may well provide a path to ones that are. This is an idea that Steven Johnson of Where Good Ideas Come From popularized called the “adjacent possible.” Where finding your way through a labyrinth of ignorance requires you to first open a door into a room of understanding, one that by its very existence has new doors to new rooms with deeper insights lurking behind them.</p><p></p><p>In most endeavors, it’s fine to be content to woodshed until you get something near perfect. You want that to be you. Grit matters. But it won’t be long until some innovation makes all that effort newly obsolete. You want that to be you, too.</p>"

              "snippet": "Fellow-Citizens of the United States:IN compliance with a custom as old as the Government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the Constitution of the United States to be taken by the President before he enters on the execution of this office. 1I do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement. 2Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican Administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that—I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so. 3Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had made this and many similar declarations and had never recanted them; and more than this, they placed in the platform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read:Resolved, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States, and especially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend; and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter what pretext, as among the gravest of crimes.4I now reiterate these sentiments, and in doing so I only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible that the property, peace, and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming Administration. I add, too, that all the protection which, consistently with the Constitution and the laws, can be given will be cheerfully given to all the States when lawfully demanded, for whatever cause—as cheerfully to one section as to another. 5There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor. The clause I now read is as plainly written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions:No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due. 6It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the intention of the lawgiver is the law. All members of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution—to this provision as much as to any other. To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause shall be delivered up their oaths are unanimous. Now, if they would make the effort in good temper, could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath? 7There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by State authority, but surely that difference is not a very material one. If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done. And should anyone in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept? 8Again: In any law upon this subject ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so that a free man be not in any case surrendered as a slave? And might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States? 9I take the official oath to-day with no mental reservations and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules; and while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations, to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed than to violate any of them trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional. 10It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President under our National Constitution. During that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have in succession administered the executive branch of the Government. They have conducted it through many perils, and generally with great success. Yet, with all this scope of precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty. A disruption of the Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted. 11I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination. Continue to execute all the express provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will endure forever, it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself. 12Again: If the United States be not a government proper, but an association of States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract, be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it? One party to a contract may violate it—break it, so to speak—but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it? 13Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution. It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation in 1778. And finally, in 1787, one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was to form a more perfect Union. 14But if destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States be lawfully possible, the Union is less perfect than before the Constitution, having lost the vital element of perpetuity. 15It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union; that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void, and that acts of violence within any State or States against the authority of the United States are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances. 16I therefore consider that in view of the Constitution and the laws the Union is unbroken, and to the extent of my ability, I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States. Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part, and I shall perform it so far as practicable unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the requisite means or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary. I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared purpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself. 17In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence, and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority. The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the Government and to collect the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere. Where hostility to the United States in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object. While the strict legal right may exist in the Government to enforce the exercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable withal that I deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices. 18The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts of the Union. So far as possible the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection. The course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper, and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised, according to circumstances actually existing and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections. 19That there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the Union at all events and are glad of any pretext to do it I will neither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word to them. To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak? 20Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes, would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it? Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence? Will you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from, will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake? 21All profess to be content in the Union if all constitutional rights can be maintained. Is it true, then, that any right plainly written in the Constitution has been denied? I think not. Happily, the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this. Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the Constitution has ever been denied. If by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right, it might in a moral point of view justify revolution; certainly would if such right were a vital one. But such is not our case. All the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the Constitution that controversies never arise concerning them. But no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration. No foresight can anticipate nor any document of reasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions. Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or by State authority? The Constitution does not expressly say. May Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories? The Constitution does not expressly say. Must Congress protect slavery in the Territories? The Constitution does not expressly say. 22From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies, and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities. If the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the Government must cease. There is no other alternative, for continuing the Government is acquiescence on one side or the other. If a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce, they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them, for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority. For instance, why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it? All who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this. 23Is there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose a new union as to produce harmony only and prevent renewed secession? 24Plainly the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy. A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is impossible. The rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left. 25I do not forget the position assumed by some that constitutional questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court, nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding in any case upon the parties to a suit as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the Government. And while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases, can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice. At the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the Government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their Government into the hands of that eminent tribunal. Nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges. It is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes. 26One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I think, can not be perfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before. The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other. 27Physically speaking, we can not separate. We can not remove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other, but the different parts of our country can not do this. They can not but remain face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you can not fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions, as to terms of intercourse, are again upon you. 28This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it. I can not be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the National Constitution amended. While I make no recommendation of amendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself; and I should, under existing circumstances, favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it. I will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others, not especially chosen for the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse. I understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution—which amendment, however, I have not seen—has passed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the States, including that of persons held to service. To avoid misconstruction of what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable. 29The Chief Magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and they have referred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the States. The people themselves can do this if also they choose, but the Executive as such has nothing to do with it. His duty is to administer the present Government as it came to his hands and to transmit it unimpaired by him to his successor. 30Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people? Is there any better or equal hope in the world? In our present differences, is either party without faith of being in the right? If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with His eternal truth and justice, be on your side of the North, or on yours of the South, that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the American people. 31By the frame of the Government under which we live this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief, and have with equal wisdom provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals. While the people retain their virtue and vigilance no Administration by any extreme of wickedness or folly can very seriously injure the Government in the short space of four years. 32My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon this whole subject. Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time. If there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately, that object will be frustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustrated by it. Such of you as are now dissatisfied still have the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point, the laws of your own framing under it; while the new Administration will have no immediate power, if it would, to change either. If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason for precipitate action. Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this favored land are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty. 33In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The Government will not assail you. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. You have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the Government, while I shall have the most solemn one to preserve, protect, and defend it. 34I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature. 35",

And might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States? 9</p><p></p><p>I take the official oath to-day with no mental reservations and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules; and while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much safer for all, both in official and private stations, to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed than to violate any of them trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional. 10</p><p></p><p>It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President under our National Constitution. During that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have in succession administered the executive branch of the Government. They have conducted it through many perils, and generally with great success. Yet, with all this scope of precedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty. A disruption of the Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted. 11</p><p></p><p>I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination. Continue to execute all the express provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will endure forever, it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself. 12</p><p></p><p>Again: If the United States be not a government proper, but an association of States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a contract, be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it? One party to a contract may violate it—break it, so to speak—but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it? 13</p><p></p><p>Descending from these general principles, we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution. It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation in 1778. And finally, in 1787, one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was to form a more perfect Union. 14</p><p></p><p>But if destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States be lawfully possible, the Union is less perfect than before the Constitution, having lost the vital element of perpetuity. 15</p><p></p><p>It follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the Union; that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void, and that acts of violence within any State or States against the authority of the United States are insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances. 16</p><p></p><p>I therefore consider that in view of the Constitution and the laws the Union is unbroken, and to the extent of my ability, I shall take care, as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States. Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part, and I shall perform it so far as practicable unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall withhold the requisite means or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary. I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the declared purpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself. 17</p><p></p><p>In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence, and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority. The power confided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and places belonging to the Government and to collect the duties and imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will be no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere. Where hostility to the United States in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object. While the strict legal right may exist in the Government to enforce the exercise of these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable withal that I deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices. 18</p><p></p><p>The mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts of the Union. So far as possible the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection. The course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper, and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised, according to circumstances actually existing and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections. 19</p><p></p><p>That there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the Union at all events and are glad of any pretext to do it I will neither affirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word to them. To those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak? 20</p><p></p><p>Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes, would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it? Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence? Will you, while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from, will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake? 21</p><p></p><p>All profess to be content in the Union if all constitutional rights can be maintained. Is it true, then, that any right plainly written in the Constitution has been denied? I think not. Happily, the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this. Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the Constitution has ever been denied. If by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right, it might in a moral point of view justify revolution; certainly would if such right were a vital one. But such is not our case. All the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations, guaranties and prohibitions, in the Constitution that controversies never arise concerning them. But no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration. No foresight can anticipate nor any document of reasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions. Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or by State authority? The Constitution does not expressly say. May Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories? The Constitution does not expressly say. Must Congress protect slavery in the Territories? The Constitution does not expressly say. 22</p><p></p><p>From questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies, and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities. If the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the Government must cease. There is no other alternative, for continuing the Government is acquiescence on one side or the other. If a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce, they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them, for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority. For instance, why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it? All who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this. 23</p><p></p><p>Is there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose a new union as to produce harmony only and prevent renewed secession? 24</p><p></p><p>Plainly the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy. A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is impossible. The rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is wholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left. 25</p><p></p><p>I do not forget the position assumed by some that constitutional questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court, nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding in any case upon the parties to a suit as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the Government. And while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it, being limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases, can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice. At the same time, the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the Government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their Government into the hands of that eminent tribunal. Nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges. It is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them, and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes. 26</p><p></p><p>One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive-slave clause of the Constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I think, can not be perfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before. The foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other. 27</p><p></p><p>Physically speaking, we can not separate. We can not remove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other, but the different parts of our country can not do this. They can not but remain face to face, and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you can not fight always; and when, after much loss on both sides and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions, as to terms of intercourse, are again upon you. 28</p><p></p><p>This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it. I can not be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the National Constitution amended. While I make no recommendation of amendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself; and I should, under existing circumstances, favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it. I will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable, in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves, instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others, not especially chosen for the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse. I understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution—which amendment, however, I have not seen—has passed Congress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the States, including that of persons held to service. To avoid misconstruction of what I have said, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so far as to say that, holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable. 29</p><p></p><p>The Chief Magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and they have referred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the States. The people themselves can do this if also they choose, but the Executive as such has nothing to do with it. His duty is to administer the present Government as it came to his hands and to transmit it unimpaired by him to his successor. 30</p><p></p><p>Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people? Is there any better or equal hope in the world? In our present differences, is either party without faith of being in the right? If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with His eternal truth and justice, be on your side of the North, or on yours of the South, that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the American people. 31</p><p></p><p>By the frame of the Government under which we live this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief, and have with equal wisdom provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals. While the people retain their virtue and vigilance no Administration by any extreme of wickedness or folly can very seriously injure the Government in the short space of four years. 32</p><p></p><p>My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon this whole subject. Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time. If there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately, that object will be frustrated by taking time; but no good object can be frustrated by it. Such of you as are now dissatisfied still have the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point, the laws of your own framing under it; while the new Administration will have no immediate power, if it would, to change either. If it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute, there still is no single good reason for precipitate action. Intelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who has never yet forsaken this favored land are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty. 33</p><p></p><p>In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The Government will not assail you. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. You have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the Government, while I shall have the most solemn one to preserve, protect, and defend it. 34</p><p></p><p>I am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature. 35</p>"

              "snippet": "As a subject for the remarks of the evening, The perpetuation of our political institutions is selected.In the great journal of things happening under the sun, we, the American people, find our account running under date of the nineteenth century of the Christian era. We find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of the earth as regards extent of territory, fertility of soil, and salubrity of climate. We find ourselves under the government of a system of political institutions conducing more essentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty than any of which the history of former times tells us. We, when mounting the stage of existence, found ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings. We toiled not in the acquirement or establishment of them; they are a legacy bequeathed us by a once hardy, brave, and patriotic, but now lamented and departed, race of ancestors. Theirs was the task (and nobly they performed it) to possess themselves, and through themselves us, of this goodly land, and to uprear upon its hills and its valleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights; 'tis ours only to transmit these—the former unprofaned by the foot of an invader, the latter undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by usurpation—to the latest generation that fate shall permit the world to know. This task gratitude to our fathers, justice to ourselves, duty to posterity, and love for our species in general, all imperatively require us faithfully to perform.How then shall we perform it? At what point shall we expect the approach of danger? By what means shall we fortify against it? Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years.At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer. If it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen we must live through all time or die by suicide.I hope I am over wary; but if I am not, there is even now something of ill omen amongst us. I mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country—the growing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts, and the worse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of justice. This disposition is awfully fearful in any and that it now exists in ours, though grating to our feelings to admit, it would be a violation of truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny. Accounts of outrages committed by mobs form the every-day news of the times. They have pervaded the country from New England to Louisiana, they are neither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former nor the burning suns of the latter; they are not the creature of climate, neither are they confined to the slaveholding or the non-slaveholding States. Alike they spring up among the pleasure-hunting masters of Southern slaves, and the order-loving citizens of the land of steady habits. Whatever then their cause may be, it is common to the whole country.It would be tedious as well as useless to recount the horrors of all of them. Those happening in the State of Mississippi and at St. Louis are perhaps the most dangerous in example and revolting to humanity. In the Mississippi case they first commenced by hanging the regular gamblers—a set of men certainly not following for a livelihood a very useful or very honest occupation, but one which, so far from being forbidden by the laws, was actually licensed by an act of the legislature passed but a single year before. Next, negroes suspected of conspiring to raise an insurrection were caught up and hanged in all parts of the State; then, white men supposed to be leagued with the negroes; and finally, strangers from neighboring States, going thither on business, were in many instances subjected to the same fate. Thus went on this process of hanging, from gamblers to negroes, from negroes to white citizens, and from these to strangers, till dead men were seen literally dangling from the boughs of trees upon every roadside, and in numbers that were almost sufficient to rival the native Spanish moss of the country as a drapery of the forest.Turn then to that horror-striking scene at St. Louis. A single victim only was sacrificed there. This story is very short, and is perhaps the most highly tragic of anything of its length that has ever been witnessed in real life. A mulatto man by the name of McIntosh was seized in the street, dragged to the suburbs of the city, chained to a tree, and actually burned to death; and all within a single hour from the time he had been a freeman attending to his own business and at peace with the world.Such are the effects of mob law, and such are the scenes becoming more and more frequent in this land so lately famed for love of law and order, and the stories of which have even now grown too familiar to attract anything more than an idle remark.But you are perhaps ready to ask, What has this to do with the perpetuation of our political institutions? I answer, It has much to do with it. Its direct consequences are, comparatively speaking, but a small evil, and much of its danger consists in the proneness of our minds to regard its direct as its only consequences. Abstractly considered, the hanging of the gamblers at Vicksburg was of but little consequence. They constitute a portion of population that is worse than useless in any community; and their death, if no pernicious example be set by it, is never matter of reasonable regret with any one. If they were annually swept from the stage of existence by the plague or smallpox, honest men would perhaps be much profited by the operation. Similar too is the correct reasoning in regard to the burning of the negro at St. Louis. He had forfeited his life by the perpetration of an outrageous murder upon one of the most worthy and respectable citizens of the city, and had he not died as he did, he must have died by the sentence of the law in a very short time afterward. As to him alone, it was as well the way it was as it could otherwise have been. But the example in either case was fearful. When men take it in their heads to-day to hang gamblers or burn murderers, they should recollect that in the confusion usually attending such transactions they will be as likely to hang or burn some one who is neither a gambler nor a murderer as one who is, and that, acting upon the example they set, the mob of to-morrow may, and probably will, hang or burn some of them by the very same mistake. And not only so; the innocent, those who have ever set their faces against violations of law in every shape, alike with the guilty fall victims to the ravages of mob law; and thus it goes on, step by step, till all the walls erected for the defense of the persons and property of individuals are trodden down and disregarded. But all this, even, is not the full extent of the evil. By such examples, by instances of the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished, the lawless in spirit are encouraged to become lawless in practice; and having been used to no restraint but dread of punishment, they thus become absolutely unrestrained. Having ever regarded government as their deadliest bane, they make a jubilee of the suspension of its operations, and pray for nothing so much as its total annihilation. While, on the other hand, good men, men who love tranquillity, who desire to abide by the laws and enjoy their benefits, who would gladly spill their blood in the defense of their country, seeing their property destroyed, their families insulted, and their lives endangered, their persons injured, and seeing nothing in prospect that forebodes a change for the better, become tired of and disgusted with a government that offers them no protection, and are not much averse to a change in which they imagine they have nothing to lose. Thus, then, by the operation of this mobocratic spirit which all must admit is now abroad in the land, the strongest bulwark of any government, and particularly of those constituted like ours, may effectually be broken down and destroyed—I mean the attachment of the people. Whenever this effect shall be produced among us; whenever the vicious portion of [our] population shall be permitted to gather in bands of hundreds and thousands, and burn churches, ravage and rob provision stores, throw printing-presses into rivers, shoot editors, and hang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure and with impunity, depend upon it, this government cannot last. By such things the feelings of the best citizens will become more or less alienated from it, and thus it will be left without friends, or with too few, and those few too weak to make their friendship effectual. At such a time, and under such circumstances, men of sufficient talent and ambition will not be wanting to seize the opportunity, strike the blow, and overturn that fair fabric which for the last half century has been the fondest hope of the lovers of freedom throughout the world.I know the American people are much attached to their government; I know they would suffer much for its sake; I know they would endure evils long and patiently before they would ever think of exchanging it for another,—yet, notwithstanding all this, if the laws be continually despised and disregarded, if their rights to be secure in their persons and property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob, the alienation of their affections from the government is the natural consequence; and to that, sooner or later, it must come.Here, then, is one point at which danger may be expected.The question recurs, How shall we fortify against it? The answer is simple. Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to his posterity swear by the blood of the Revolution never to violate in the least particular the laws of the country, and never to tolerate their violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and laws let every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred honor—let every man remember that to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the charter of his own and his children's liberty. Let reverence for the laws be breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap; let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges; let it be written in primers, spelling-books, and in almanacs; let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short, let it become the political religion of the nation; and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave and the gay of all sexes and tongues and colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars.While ever a state of feeling such as this shall universally or even very generally prevail throughout the nation, vain will be every effort, and fruitless every attempt, to subvert our national freedom.When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there are no bad laws, or that grievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do mean to say that although bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, still, while they continue in force, for the sake of example they should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be made for them with the least possible delay, but till then let them, if not too intolerable, be borne with.There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law. In any case that may arise, as, for instance, the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two positions is necessarily true—that is, the thing is right within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of all law and all good citizens, or it is wrong, and therefore proper to be prohibited by legal enactments; and in neither case is the interposition of mob law either necessary, justifiable, or excusable.But it may be asked, Why suppose danger to our political institutions? Have we not preserved them for more than fifty years? And why may we not for fifty times as long?We hope there is no sufficient reason. We hope all danger may be overcome; but to conclude that no danger may ever arise would itself be extremely dangerous. There are now, and will hereafter be, many causes, dangerous in their tendency, which have not existed heretofore, and which are not too insignificant to merit attention. That our government should have been maintained in its original form, from its establishment until now, is not much to be wondered at. It had many props to support it through that period, which now are decayed and crumbled away. Through that period it was felt by all to be an undecided experiment; now it is understood to be a successful one. Then, all that sought celebrity and fame and distinction expected to find them in the success of that experiment. Their all was staked upon it; their destiny was inseparably linked with it. Their ambition aspired to display before an admiring world a practical demonstration of the truth of a proposition which had hitherto been considered at best no better than problematical—namely, the capability of a people to govern themselves. If they succeeded they were to be immortalized; their names were to be transferred to counties, and cities, and rivers, and mountains; and to be revered and sung, toasted through all time. If they failed, they were to be called knaves, and fools, and fanatics for a fleeting hour; then to sink and be forgotten. They succeeded. The experiment is successful, and thousands have won their deathless names in making it so. But the game is caught; and I believe it is true that with the catching end the pleasures of the chase. This field of glory is harvested, and the crop is already appropriated. But new reapers will arise, and they too will seek a field. It is to deny what the history of the world tells us is true, to suppose that men of ambition and talents will not continue to spring up amongst us. And when they do, they will as naturally seek the gratification of their ruling passion as others have done before them. The question then is, Can that gratification be found in supporting and maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others? Most certainly it cannot. Many great and good men, sufficiently qualified for any task they should undertake, may ever be found whose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat in Congress, a gubernatorial or a presidential chair; but such belong not to the family of the lion or the tribe of the eagle. What! think you these places would satisfy an Alexander, a Caesar, or a Napoleon? Never! Towering genius disdains a beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto unexplored. It sees no distinction in adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected to the memory of others. It denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief. It scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor, however illustrious. It thirsts and burns for distinction; and if possible, it will have it, whether at the expense of emancipating slaves or enslaving freemen. Is it unreasonable, then, to expect that some man possessed of the loftiest genius, coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost stretch, will at some time spring up among us? And when such an one does, it will require the people to be united with each other, attached to the government and laws, and generally intelligent, to successfully frustrate his designs.Distinction will be his paramount object, and although he would as willingly, perhaps more so, acquire it by doing good as harm, yet, that opportunity being past, and nothing left to be done in the way of building up, he would set boldly to the task of pulling down.Here then is a probable case, highly dangerous, and such an one as could not have well existed heretofore.Another reason which once was, but which, to the same extent, is now no more, has done much in maintaining our institutions thus far. I mean the powerful influence which the interesting scenes of the Revolution had upon the passions of the people as distinguished from their judgment. By this influence, the jealousy, envy, and avarice incident to our nature and so common to a state of peace, prosperity, and conscious strength, were for the time in a great measure smothered and rendered inactive, while the deep-rooted principles of hate, and the powerful motive of revenge, instead of being turned against each other, were directed exclusively against the British nation. And thus, from the force of circumstances, the basest principles of our nature were either made to lie dormant, or to become the active agents in the advancement of the noblest of causes—that of establishing and maintaining civil and religious liberty.But this state of feeling must fade, is fading, has faded, with the circumstances that produced it.I do not mean to say that the scenes of the Revolution are now or ever will be entirely forgotten, but that, like everything else, they must fade upon the memory of the world, and grow more and more dim by the lapse of time. In history, we hope, they will be read of, and recounted, so long as the Bible shall be read; but even granting that they will, their influence cannot be what it heretofore has been. Even then they cannot be so universally known nor so vividly felt as they were by the generation just gone to rest. At the close of that struggle, nearly every adult male had been a participator in some of its scenes. The consequence was that of those scenes, in the form of a husband, a father, a son, or a brother, a living history was to be found in every family—a history bearing the indubitable testimonies of its own authenticity, in the limbs mangled, in the scars of wounds received, in the midst of the very scenes related—a history, too, that could be read and understood alike by all, the wise and the ignorant, the learned and the unlearned. But those histories are gone. They can be read no more forever. They were a fortress of strength; but what invading foeman could never do, the silent artillery of time has done—the leveling of its walls. They are gone. They were a forest of giant oaks; but the all-restless hurricane has swept over them, and left only here and there a lonely trunk, despoiled of its verdure, shorn of its foliage, unshading and unshaded, to murmur in a few more gentle breezes, and to combat with its mutilated limbs a few more ruder storms, then to sink and be no more.They were pillars of the temple of liberty; and now that they have crumbled away that temple must fall unless we, their descendants, supply their places with other pillars, hewn from the solid quarry of sober reason. Passion has helped us, but can do so no more. It will in future be our enemy. Reason—cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason—must furnish all the materials for our future support and defense. Let those materials be molded into general intelligence, sound morality, and, in particular, a reverence for the Constitution and laws; and that we improved to the last, that we remained free to the last, that we revered his name to the last, that during his long sleep we permitted no hostile foot to pass over or desecrate his resting place, shall be that which to learn the last trump shall awaken our Washington.Upon these let the proud fabric of freedom rest, as the rock of its basis; and as truly as has been said of the only greater institution, the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.",
              "lyrics": "<p>As a subject for the remarks of the evening, The perpetuation of our political institutions is selected.</p><p></p><p>In the great journal of things happening under the sun, we, the American people, find our account running under date of the nineteenth century of the Christian era. We find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of the earth as regards extent of territory, fertility of soil, and salubrity of climate. We find ourselves under the government of a system of political institutions conducing more essentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty than any of which the history of former times tells us. We, when mounting the stage of existence, found ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings. We toiled not in the acquirement or establishment of them; they are a legacy bequeathed us by a once hardy, brave, and patriotic, but now lamented and departed, race of ancestors. Theirs was the task (and nobly they performed it) to possess themselves, and through themselves us, of this goodly land, and to uprear upon its hills and its valleys a political edifice of liberty and equal rights; 'tis ours only to transmit these—the former unprofaned by the foot of an invader, the latter undecayed by the lapse of time and untorn by usurpation—to the latest generation that fate shall permit the world to know. This task gratitude to our fathers, justice to ourselves, duty to posterity, and love for our species in general, all imperatively require us faithfully to perform.</p><p></p><p>How then shall we perform it? At what point shall we expect the approach of danger? By what means shall we fortify against it? Shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the Blue Ridge in a trial of a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer. If it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us; it cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen we must live through all time or die by suicide.</p><p></p><p>I hope I am over wary; but if I am not, there is even now something of ill omen amongst us. I mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country—the growing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions in lieu of the sober judgment of courts, and the worse than savage mobs for the executive ministers of justice. This disposition is awfully fearful in any and that it now exists in ours, though grating to our feelings to admit, it would be a violation of truth and an insult to our intelligence to deny. Accounts of outrages committed by mobs form the every-day news of the times. They have pervaded the country from New England to Louisiana, they are neither peculiar to the eternal snows of the former nor the burning suns of the latter; they are not the creature of climate, neither are they confined to the slaveholding or the non-slaveholding States. Alike they spring up among the pleasure-hunting masters of Southern slaves, and the order-loving citizens of the land of steady habits. Whatever then their cause may be, it is common to the whole country.</p><p></p><p>It would be tedious as well as useless to recount the horrors of all of them. Those happening in the State of Mississippi and at St. Louis are perhaps the most dangerous in example and revolting to humanity. In the Mississippi case they first commenced by hanging the regular gamblers—a set of men certainly not following for a livelihood a very useful or very honest occupation, but one which, so far from being forbidden by the laws, was actually licensed by an act of the legislature passed but a single year before. Next, negroes suspected of conspiring to raise an insurrection were caught up and hanged in all parts of the State; then, white men supposed to be leagued with the negroes; and finally, strangers from neighboring States, going thither on business, were in many instances subjected to the same fate. Thus went on this process of hanging, from gamblers to negroes, from negroes to white citizens, and from these to strangers, till dead men were seen literally dangling from the boughs of trees upon every roadside, and in numbers that were almost sufficient to rival the native Spanish moss of the country as a drapery of the forest.</p><p></p><p>Turn then to that horror-striking scene at St. Louis. A single victim only was sacrificed there. This story is very short, and is perhaps the most highly tragic of anything of its length that has ever been witnessed in real life. A mulatto man by the name of McIntosh was seized in the street, dragged to the suburbs of the city, chained to a tree, and actually burned to death; and all within a single hour from the time he had been a freeman attending to his own business and at peace with the world.</p><p></p><p>Such are the effects of mob law, and such are the scenes becoming more and more frequent in this land so lately famed for love of law and order, and the stories of which have even now grown too familiar to attract anything more than an idle remark.</p><p></p><p>But you are perhaps ready to ask, What has this to do with the perpetuation of our political institutions? I answer, It has much to do with it. Its direct consequences are, comparatively speaking, but a small evil, and much of its danger consists in the proneness of our minds to regard its direct as its only consequences. Abstractly considered, the hanging of the gamblers at Vicksburg was of but little consequence. They constitute a portion of population that is worse than useless in any community; and their death, if no pernicious example be set by it, is never matter of reasonable regret with any one. If they were annually swept from the stage of existence by the plague or smallpox, honest men would perhaps be much profited by the operation. Similar too is the correct reasoning in regard to the burning of the negro at St. Louis. He had forfeited his life by the perpetration of an outrageous murder upon one of the most worthy and respectable citizens of the city, and had he not died as he did, he must have died by the sentence of the law in a very short time afterward. As to him alone, it was as well the way it was as it could otherwise have been. But the example in either case was fearful. When men take it in their heads to-day to hang gamblers or burn murderers, they should recollect that in the confusion usually attending such transactions they will be as likely to hang or burn some one who is neither a gambler nor a murderer as one who is, and that, acting upon the example they set, the mob of to-morrow may, and probably will, hang or burn some of them by the very same mistake. And not only so; the innocent, those who have ever set their faces against violations of law in every shape, alike with the guilty fall victims to the ravages of mob law; and thus it goes on, step by step, till all the walls erected for the defense of the persons and property of individuals are trodden down and disregarded. But all this, even, is not the full extent of the evil. By such examples, by instances of the perpetrators of such acts going unpunished, the lawless in spirit are encouraged to become lawless in practice; and having been used to no restraint but dread of punishment, they thus become absolutely unrestrained. Having ever regarded government as their deadliest bane, they make a jubilee of the suspension of its operations, and pray for nothing so much as its total annihilation. While, on the other hand, good men, men who love tranquillity, who desire to abide by the laws and enjoy their benefits, who would gladly spill their blood in the defense of their country, seeing their property destroyed, their families insulted, and their lives endangered, their persons injured, and seeing nothing in prospect that forebodes a change for the better, become tired of and disgusted with a government that offers them no protection, and are not much averse to a change in which they imagine they have nothing to lose. Thus, then, by the operation of this mobocratic spirit which all must admit is now abroad in the land, the strongest bulwark of any government, and particularly of those constituted like ours, may effectually be broken down and destroyed—I mean the attachment of the people. Whenever this effect shall be produced among us; whenever the vicious portion of [our] population shall be permitted to gather in bands of hundreds and thousands, and burn churches, ravage and rob provision stores, throw printing-presses into rivers, shoot editors, and hang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure and with impunity, depend upon it, this government cannot last. By such things the feelings of the best citizens will become more or less alienated from it, and thus it will be left without friends, or with too few, and those few too weak to make their friendship effectual. At such a time, and under such circumstances, men of sufficient talent and ambition will not be wanting to seize the opportunity, strike the blow, and overturn that fair fabric which for the last half century has been the fondest hope of the lovers of freedom throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>I know the American people are much attached to their government; I know they would suffer much for its sake; I know they would endure evils long and patiently before they would ever think of exchanging it for another,—yet, notwithstanding all this, if the laws be continually despised and disregarded, if their rights to be secure in their persons and property are held by no better tenure than the caprice of a mob, the alienation of their affections from the government is the natural consequence; and to that, sooner or later, it must come.</p><p></p><p>Here, then, is one point at which danger may be expected.</p><p></p><p>The question recurs, How shall we fortify against it? The answer is simple. Let every American, every lover of liberty, every well-wisher to his posterity swear by the blood of the Revolution never to violate in the least particular the laws of the country, and never to tolerate their violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and laws let every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred honor—let every man remember that to violate the law is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the charter of his own and his children's liberty. Let reverence for the laws be breathed by every American mother to the lisping babe that prattles on her lap; let it be taught in schools, in seminaries, and in colleges; let it be written in primers, spelling-books, and in almanacs; let it be preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short, let it become the political religion of the nation; and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the grave and the gay of all sexes and tongues and colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its altars.</p><p></p><p>While ever a state of feeling such as this shall universally or even very generally prevail throughout the nation, vain will be every effort, and fruitless every attempt, to subvert our national freedom.</p><p></p><p>When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there are no bad laws, or that grievances may not arise for the redress of which no legal provisions have been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do mean to say that although bad laws, if they exist, should be repealed as soon as possible, still, while they continue in force, for the sake of example they should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be made for them with the least possible delay, but till then let them, if not too intolerable, be borne with.</p><p></p><p>There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law. In any case that may arise, as, for instance, the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two positions is necessarily true—that is, the thing is right within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of all law and all good citizens, or it is wrong, and therefore proper to be prohibited by legal enactments; and in neither case is the interposition of mob law either necessary, justifiable, or excusable.</p><p></p><p>But it may be asked, Why suppose danger to our political institutions? Have we not preserved them for more than fifty years? And why may we not for fifty times as long?</p><p></p><p>We hope there is no sufficient reason. We hope all danger may be overcome; but to conclude that no danger may ever arise would itself be extremely dangerous. There are now, and will hereafter be, many causes, dangerous in their tendency, which have not existed heretofore, and which are not too insignificant to merit attention. That our government should have been maintained in its original form, from its establishment until now, is not much to be wondered at. It had many props to support it through that period, which now are decayed and crumbled away. Through that period it was felt by all to be an undecided experiment; now it is understood to be a successful one. Then, all that sought celebrity and fame and distinction expected to find them in the success of that experiment. Their all was staked upon it; their destiny was inseparably linked with it. Their ambition aspired to display before an admiring world a practical demonstration of the truth of a proposition which had hitherto been considered at best no better than problematical—namely, the capability of a people to govern themselves. If they succeeded they were to be immortalized; their names were to be transferred to counties, and cities, and rivers, and mountains; and to be revered and sung, toasted through all time. If they failed, they were to be called knaves, and fools, and fanatics for a fleeting hour; then to sink and be forgotten. They succeeded. The experiment is successful, and thousands have won their deathless names in making it so. But the game is caught; and I believe it is true that with the catching end the pleasures of the chase. This field of glory is harvested, and the crop is already appropriated. But new reapers will arise, and they too will seek a field. It is to deny what the history of the world tells us is true, to suppose that men of ambition and talents will not continue to spring up amongst us. And when they do, they will as naturally seek the gratification of their ruling passion as others have done before them. The question then is, Can that gratification be found in supporting and maintaining an edifice that has been erected by others? Most certainly it cannot. Many great and good men, sufficiently qualified for any task they should undertake, may ever be found whose ambition would aspire to nothing beyond a seat in Congress, a gubernatorial or a presidential chair; but such belong not to the family of the lion or the tribe of the eagle. What! think you these places would satisfy an Alexander, a Caesar, or a Napoleon? Never! Towering genius disdains a beaten path. It seeks regions hitherto unexplored. It sees no distinction in adding story to story upon the monuments of fame erected to the memory of others. It denies that it is glory enough to serve under any chief. It scorns to tread in the footsteps of any predecessor, however illustrious. It thirsts and burns for distinction; and if possible, it will have it, whether at the expense of emancipating slaves or enslaving freemen. Is it unreasonable, then, to expect that some man possessed of the loftiest genius, coupled with ambition sufficient to push it to its utmost stretch, will at some time spring up among us? And when such an one does, it will require the people to be united with each other, attached to the government and laws, and generally intelligent, to successfully frustrate his designs.</p><p></p><p>Distinction will be his paramount object, and although he would as willingly, perhaps more so, acquire it by doing good as harm, yet, that opportunity being past, and nothing left to be done in the way of building up, he would set boldly to the task of pulling down.</p><p></p><p>Here then is a probable case, highly dangerous, and such an one as could not have well existed heretofore.</p><p></p><p>Another reason which once was, but which, to the same extent, is now no more, has done much in maintaining our institutions thus far. I mean the powerful influence which the interesting scenes of the Revolution had upon the passions of the people as distinguished from their judgment. By this influence, the jealousy, envy, and avarice incident to our nature and so common to a state of peace, prosperity, and conscious strength, were for the time in a great measure smothered and rendered inactive, while the deep-rooted principles of hate, and the powerful motive of revenge, instead of being turned against each other, were directed exclusively against the British nation. And thus, from the force of circumstances, the basest principles of our nature were either made to lie dormant, or to become the active agents in the advancement of the noblest of causes—that of establishing and maintaining civil and religious liberty.</p><p></p><p>But this state of feeling must fade, is fading, has faded, with the circumstances that produced it.</p><p></p><p>I do not mean to say that the scenes of the Revolution are now or ever will be entirely forgotten, but that, like everything else, they must fade upon the memory of the world, and grow more and more dim by the lapse of time. In history, we hope, they will be read of, and recounted, so long as the Bible shall be read; but even granting that they will, their influence cannot be what it heretofore has been. Even then they cannot be so universally known nor so vividly felt as they were by the generation just gone to rest. At the close of that struggle, nearly every adult male had been a participator in some of its scenes. The consequence was that of those scenes, in the form of a husband, a father, a son, or a brother, a living history was to be found in every family—a history bearing the indubitable testimonies of its own authenticity, in the limbs mangled, in the scars of wounds received, in the midst of the very scenes related—a history, too, that could be read and understood alike by all, the wise and the ignorant, the learned and the unlearned. But those histories are gone. They can be read no more forever. They were a fortress of strength; but what invading foeman could never do, the silent artillery of time has done—the leveling of its walls. They are gone. They were a forest of giant oaks; but the all-restless hurricane has swept over them, and left only here and there a lonely trunk, despoiled of its verdure, shorn of its foliage, unshading and unshaded, to murmur in a few more gentle breezes, and to combat with its mutilated limbs a few more ruder storms, then to sink and be no more.</p><p></p><p>They were pillars of the temple of liberty; and now that they have crumbled away that temple must fall unless we, their descendants, supply their places with other pillars, hewn from the solid quarry of sober reason. Passion has helped us, but can do so no more. It will in future be our enemy. Reason—cold, calculating, unimpassioned reason—must furnish all the materials for our future support and defense. Let those materials be molded into general intelligence, sound morality, and, in particular, a reverence for the Constitution and laws; and that we improved to the last, that we remained free to the last, that we revered his name to the last, that during his long sleep we permitted no hostile foot to pass over or desecrate his resting place, shall be that which to learn the last trump shall awaken our Washington.</p><p></p><p>Upon these let the proud fabric of freedom rest, as the rock of its basis; and as truly as has been said of the only greater institution, the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.</p>"

Fell, Esq.Springfield, Dec: 20. 1859My dear Sir:Herewith is a little sketch, as you requested– There is not much of it, for the reason, I suppose, that there is not much of me– If anything is made out of it, I wish it to be modest, and not to go beyond the materials– If it were thought necessary to incorporate any thing from any of my speeches, I suppose there would be no objection– Of course it must not appear to have been written by myself– Yours very trulyA. Lincoln[ Enclosure:]I was born Feb. 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. My parents were both born in Virginia, of undistinguished families — second families, perhaps I should say– My Mother, who died in my ninth tenth year, was of a family of the name of Hanks, some of whom now reside in Adams, and others in Macon counties, Illinois– My paternal grandfather, Abraham Lincoln, emigrated from Rockingham County, Virginia, to Kentucky, about 1781 or 2, when, a year or two later, he was killed by indians, not in battle, but by stealth, when he was laboring to open a farm in the forest– His ancestors, who were quakers, went to Virginia from Berks County, Pennsylvania– An effort to identify them with the New-England family of the same name ended in nothing more definite, than a similarity of Christian names in both families, such as Enoch, Levi, Mordecai, Solomon, Abraham, and the like–My father, at the death of his father, was but six years of age; and he grew up, litterally without education– He removed from Kentucky to what is now Spencer county, Indiana, in my eighth year– We reached our new home about the time the State came into the Union– It was a wild region, with many bears and other wild animals still in the woods– There I grew up– There were some schools, so called; but no qualification was ever required of a teacher, beyond the reading, writing, and Arithmetic “readin, writin, and cipherin” to the Rule of Three– If a straggler supposed to understand latin, happened to sojourn in the neighborhood, he was looked upon as a wizzard– There was absolutely nothing to excite ambition for education. Of course when I came of age I did not know much– Still somehow, I could read, write, and cipher to the Rule of Three, but that was all– I have not been to school since– The little advance I now have upon this store of education, I have picked up from time to time under the pressure of necessity–I was raised to farm work, which I continued till I was twenty two– At twenty one I came to Illinois, and passed the first year in Illinois– Macon County — Then I got to New-Salem ( then at that time in Sangamon, now in Menard County, where I remained a year as a sort of Clerk in a store– then came the Black-Hawk war; and I was elected a Captain of Volunteers — a success which gave me more pleasure than any I have had since– I went the campaign, was [elected], ran for the Legislature the same year (1832) and was beaten — the only time I ever have been beaten by the people– The next, and three succeeding biennial elections, I was elected to the Legislature– I was not a candidate afterwards. During this Legislative period I had studied law, and removed to Springfield to make practice it– In 1846 I was once elected to the lower House of Congress– Was not a candidate for re-election– From 1849 to 1854, both inclusive, practiced law more assiduously than ever before– Always a whig in politics, and generally on the whig electoral tickets, making active canvasses– I was losing interest in politics, when the repeal of the Missouri Compromise aroused me again– What I have done since then is pretty well known –If any personal description of me is thought desired desirable, it may be said, I am, in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and grey eyes — no other marks or brands recollected–",
